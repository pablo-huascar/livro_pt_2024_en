    "text": "Introduction\nCommenting on the construction of this book means discussing a technical production. According to the latest CAPES classification (Hemerly et al., 2019), a publishing product is defined as resulting from “the processes of editing and publishing fiction and non-fiction works. It includes planning and executing, intellectually and graphically, books, encyclopedias, preparing texts, illustrations, layout, etc., linked to the Program (projects, lines, students/graduates)” (p. 41). Broadly speaking, this is what we did, and by this definition, we are well-aligned.\nThat said, it is necessary to state that producing this book was a way to free ourselves from some constraints, although we are still bound to another, not by choice, but by an institutional framework that we can at least qualify as questionable. We will return to this particular institutional constraint later.\nThe first constraint we freed ourselves from by constructing this book was that of publishers. In an analog world, where books needed to be printed and distributed for their content to be accessed, publishers played a significant role. Maintaining the necessary infrastructure for a book to go from someone’s mind to the reader was expensive, and most people who wanted to publish something could not afford the required resources. If this is true, on the other hand, the decision about what the public should read was concentrated in the hands of a few companies, and what dictated this decision was the potential commercial return of a work. There was, therefore, an oligopoly on thought.\nThis same logic applies to any other form of expression that depended on analog means and structures to be created and distributed: music, films, news, etc. However, today we live in a world where the production and transmission of information are digital. Thus, just as it is no longer necessary to have a soundboard to record or a vinyl record to materialize a phonogram, printed paper is dispensable (which does not mean it has no value). It is also no longer necessary to have a truck transporting tons of books back and forth for people to access them.\nDespite this liberation, this story, which is still ongoing, so far, does not seem to have a happy ending. Capitalism is like the Borg: it always finds a way to adapt and keeps insisting that resistance is futile. In the new world of the internet, the oligopoly of analog production and distribution by publishers, record companies, radio, and TV was replaced by that of large technology companies through streaming platforms, whether video, audio, or even books. Yes, we can create and distribute books, music, and news without intermediaries, but only those linked to the most well-known transmission platforms have a chance to appear and stand out, with rare exceptions.\nDespite this setback, the initial premise, that it is possible to create and distribute without intermediaries, is valid, can be explored, and is what we did. In this context, this book was developed with free and open-source software called Quarto, which is platform-agnostic. In our case, R and R Studio were the tools used to mediate our relationship with the documents and other files we created. Furthermore, all the code used for the book’s production is publicly available on GitHub.\nIn this new form of digital organization, we are also free from the linearity imposed by the analog medium. When we used a cassette tape, to get to the song we wanted to hear, we had to fast-forward to the point where it was. If we were watching a TV show and needed to go to the bathroom for a few moments, we would miss that crucial moment of the series where the entire plot was revealed. Today, we can even pause a live TV broadcast and return later.\nThus, in a book, we had a series of printed words and pictures and would go from page to page to where we wanted. Visually impaired people needed a Braille version to access the material autonomously. In digital versions, the book does not need to have only words or pictures, and they do not have a concrete form. In this sense, concerning visual impairment, screen readers are common and increasingly accurate, which, as long as the material is properly organized, allows it to be accessed by blind or low-vision people. Even the figures, if audio-described (and in our case, they are), can be “read.”\nIn this context, any of the chapters of this book can be accessed with a click, and there is a search tool to find terms or concepts one wishes to retrieve. Since we do not only need to have words, we can, for example, place videos wherever we wish and blocks for people to execute R codes. Here are some examples of how the possibility of bringing together various media in a single space was utilized in this production:\nThese are examples of what can be done, and as researchers better understand these intersection possibilities, much more can be articulated. There is a universe of creativity to be explored.\nThe third constraint does not depend solely on technological means to be freed from. It depends on a political struggle to rethink scientific production in Brazil, especially the ways of evaluating graduate programs, granting scholarships, and funding researchers. I have heard from more than one sensible voice that Einstein would never have an approved project in Brazil. Over the years, a neoliberal managerial logic has taken over Brazilian education at all levels and seems to have taken root in evaluation mechanisms.\nThe formula is very similar to the financialization that has taken over companies: only the quarterly profit for dividend distribution and to increase managers’ bonuses matters. Immediate profitability must come at any cost, even if it means making cuts that will take away innovation possibilities and, in the long run, render the company uncompetitive in the market.\nIn graduate studies, what we see is: publish massively, even if they are absolutely irrelevant products, but that score points in the miraculously elaborated evaluation tables. The more you do this, the more access to resources and “prestige in the field” you will have, to perhaps someday do what you truly believe needs to be done.\nObviously, we are not saying that all production is irrelevant; there are numerous innovations and discoveries that emerge amidst this perverse logic, but the caricature serves to show the path this model leads us down. With this caveat made, in the long run, it is necessary to denounce that this scoring table model applied to graduate studies can make scientific production voluminous but without any impact, whether in basic science, where we simply want to understand how the universe works, or in the attempt to solve the numerous problems the country faces.\nThis model already has by-products: the trade in participation in collection books, whose advertisements claim to be “compliant with Qualis CAPES,” and perhaps even more ethically questionable, the sale of co-authorship in chapters. If the game is to score points, what’s the problem with selling points to those who want or need them? The logic is simple: pay, publish, and score.\nAnd what do we do? We invent a pretty name to avoid going to the root of the problem: they are “predatory” publishers and journals. We will make endless lists to put them on our academic vanity bonfire, proclaim to the four winds that these practices need to be combated, and continue avoiding the discussion that really matters, which is to ask ourselves why the evaluation has this purely quantitative character based on questionable scoring criteria. There are ‘qualitative’ elements in the evaluation forms, but, in the end, it is the volume of “well-scored” production that counts, and the competition between programs is the basis of the evaluation system.\nIn this sense, we will not criticize the people who organize and make money from this trade, even if the practice is morally questionable (tell us something in capitalism that isn’t?), nor the people who participate in it, because they are not the cause of the problem but the most obvious consequence of the model we are questioning. We will not criticize, but we have to ask ourselves: does anyone believe in the relevance of most of the “knowledge” generated in this academic fruit market? And this market arises from the managerial model that needs to create scoring tables to say who is more or who is less in this four-yearly ranking of graduate programs.\nA small addendum to show how this spreads throughout Brazilian education. Something similar happens in basic education when looking at large-scale assessments, a U.S. proposal that has already proven flawed there, but which is still treated with deference here due to the enormous influence that private foundations linked to large corporate groups have on educational policies. Several municipalities display advertisements showing the scores that municipalities and schools obtained in the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB). Political opponents will accuse managers of fraud to get the scores, but in many cases, there is no fraud in the sense they are accusing.\nThe fraud lies in treating education as training children to solve Portuguese and math tests, the only subjects evaluated. This leads to what is called curriculum narrowing (Gesqui, 2015; Rubio & Mendes, 2020), where all other subjects are relegated to second place. There are cases where history, geography, and any other subject teachers are pressured to teach the topics that will be covered in external assessments and abandon their content. If we think about it, even Portuguese and math are sidelined because they themselves do not matter, but rather the children’s ability to solve the tests. Critical thinking, citizenship, scientific education, for what? What I need is to advertise how high the municipality’s score was.\nTranslating this statement to graduate studies: cutting-edge scientific production, solving the country’s problems, making discoveries about the universe, for what? What I need is to score, score, and score to reach the Olympus of grade 7. In both cases, what has this brought positive to society? Nobody cares because what is at stake is the quarterly result to distribute dividends to shareholders and give bonuses to managers. In this logic, the long term is for those who like to philosophize and not for those who like to make money or score.\nHere, another addendum: will we criticize those who play the game as it is set? Never! People are trying to survive in this jungle of competition that this evaluation model has created and are workers with precarious working conditions who, in the midst of all this, try to do something relevant for the world. What we can do is invite them to reflection and engagement in the struggle for better working conditions, which involves a profound change in how scientific production is evaluated in Brazil. Did you think we ourselves would abandon this game because there is no way? You thought wrong…! The first thing capitalism condemns us to is fatalism, and we will not surrender to it.\nAs we said before, we purposely caricature the path of scientific irrelevance to which this model leads, but we recognize the struggle of teachers and researchers to produce high-level knowledge in a country that treats science and technology as something subordinate. If here we make the denunciation, it is not against the workers, but against the capitalist system that intertwined its financial logic in the management and evaluation of graduate studies and proclaims the end of history, as if nothing else were possible beyond the deepening of this perverse model.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThis chapter aims to report the experiences of creating podcasts, as communication products, by VIESES: Group of Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation, between 2020 and 2021, as strategies for dialogical production and sharing knowledge about Psychology, human rights, and contemporary socio-psychological processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This laboratory is part of the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought several challenges to the academic activities of VIESES, which, since its creation, occurred through the insertion and joint composition in peripheral territories of Fortaleza. With the implementation of emergency remote activities at UFC to ensure physical distancing for the prevention of COVID-19 infections, it was necessary to reinvent formative strategies that maintained the dialogical ethos of our knowledge production in Psychology, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels (Barros et al., 2023).\nThe experiences of creating 4 podcasts by VIESES within this context will be reported: Presentemente, #TraçandoVáriosPlanos, Artes Insurgentes, and Café da Tarde. The goal of these initiatives was for knowledge production, in a scenario of extreme fragility in guaranteeing rights, to act politically for visibility, articulation, and production of other channels of listening to an insurgent psychology (Barros et al., 2019). The aim was, above all, to act against the historical-social logics of oppression, aggravated by the pandemic context, and to serve as a tool that blurs hegemonic boundaries of knowledge construction, using cybernetic tools to overcome these challenges.",

    "text": "1.2 Presentemente Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe Presentemente podcast, whose name is inspired by the song “Sujeito de Sorte” by singer Belchior, was created in 2020 with the aim of pluralizing and resonating discussions about the present from critical and diverse perspectives on topics pertinent to the field of human rights, valuing practices of resistance and ways of staying “sane, safe, and strong.” The project was made possible by a VIESES team composed of undergraduate students and a faculty advisor, involving topic selection, contacting guests1, script creation, editing, posting episodes on podcast aggregators, and promoting artwork on social media. The discussions in each episode are conducted by people affected in various ways by the topic, either from experience in social movements, academic productions, or life experiences, aiming to diversify the debates and elucidate various perspectives. Each episode, averaging 50 minutes, was released biweekly on Thursdays between July and October 2020. The first season of the podcast consists of six episodes. The titles covered, in order of publication, were: “Hatred and Cancellation Today,” “Racism and Anti-Racist Struggle,” “Peripheries and Poetic Re-Existences,” “LGBTQIA+ Lives and LGBTFOBIA,” and “Childhoods in Brazil.” The season finale was an extra episode titled “Mental Health and Youth from the Periphery: Psychosocial Distress and Care Production in the Pandemic Context,” resulting from a podcast episode submitted to the XI International Symposium on Brazilian Youth (JUBRA) held in December 2020.\nThe second season of the Presentemente podcast is still in progress. Four episodes have been released, from July to September 2021, on the themes of “Arts and Peripheries on the Agenda” and “Cultural Appropriation and Colonialities,” with the third and fourth episodes being two parts of the same conversation titled “Indigenous Peoples in Brazil.”",

    "text": "1.3 #TraçandoVáriosPlanos Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe #TraçandoVáriosPlanos podcast, which dialogues with the song “Sulamericano” by the Bahian musical group BaianaSystem, focuses on Social Psychology and Political Psychology readings on contemporary socio-psychological themes and processes. More than 14 episodes were released between 2020 and 2021, across the first two seasons. The production of #TraçandoVáriosPlanos always involves the participation of the advising professor or teaching internship students in the presentation, as well as guests from the academic context. All episodes, averaging 40 minutes, are available for free on YouTube on the Pós-PsicologiaS UFC channel and also on Spotify.\nThe released episodes covered themes such as: “Psychosocial Aspects of Violence and Social Psychology”; “Neoliberalism and the Necroeconomy of Punishment: Racism, Mass Incarceration, and Pandemic Impacts”; “Social Psychology and Hate Speech Today”; “Critical Criminology, Feminist Criminology, and the Problem of Punitive Penal Selectivity”; “Neoliberal Subjectivation and Social Psychology”; “Social Transformations of Violence and Prison Dynamics: The Case of Ceará”; “Beyond Prison: Alternative Penal Policy or Alternative to Penal Policy?”; “Intersectionality, Production of Subjectivities, and Social Psychology”; “Gender and Subjectivity from Feminist Studies”; and “Can the White Listen? – Reflections on Whiteness”; “Social Psychology and Inequalities in the COVID-19 Pandemic”; “Psychology and Extremisms Today”; “Psychosocial Aspects of Racism and Anti-Racist Psychology”; and “Denialism and the Public Dimension of Mourning in the Pandemic: Connections Between Subjectivity and Politics.”\nIn 2022, a special season on Psychology and Human Rights was produced. Its 12 episodes came from panels held during an extension course on this theme promoted by VIESES in 2021.\n#TraçandoVáriosPlanos has proven to be an important strategy for maintaining and enhancing the connection of students with the Psychology course at UFC by offering learning and reflection alternatives in the face of reality and challenges posed by social distancing, being fundamental to expanding the reach of themes debated by VIESES far beyond its student body through new communication and information tools.",

Aimed at encouraging insurgent practices and strengthening the cultural memory of urban peripheries by enhancing the artistic-cultural expressions of youth collectives from the neighborhoods of Grande Bom Jardim (GBJ), in Fortaleza-CE2, the project has shown a significant social role in peripheral territories, especially with students from public schools and members of youth collectives from GBJ. Since the first semester of 2021, one of the project’s action fronts has been producing a podcast to disseminate and dialogue with members of actions, activities, and projects within youth collectives that fight for rights in GBJ and use art as a tool of struggle, from various artistic language expressions, such as visual arts, literature, music, dance, and theater.\nSo far, the podcast, titled “Artes Insurgentes: Collectivizing Resistances,” has three episodes ranging from 20 to 50 minutes, available on Spotify. The first episode consists of a presentation of the project and its proposals; the second episode addresses issues related to the 2021 Youth Festival and its repercussions for the local scene; and the third episode, the most recent, discusses actions taken by the Specialized Technical Articulation Nucleus (Narte) of the Bom Jardim Cultural Center and its resonances in the GBJ community.\nIn 2022, the first episode of the Artes Insurgentes podcast, titled “Resistances and Alliances in the Breaks,” was released, addressing how residents of the Grande Bom Jardim region participated in political and social movements related to combating violence and fighting for human rights in their territories in the city.",

Aiming to promote welcoming actions at the university in times of weakened ties and attacks on public education, the Café da Tarde podcast sought to constitute, in the virtual environment, exchanges where everyday affections, student experiences, affective places, and processes of invention and sharing were invoked as forms of alliance and resistance to discouragement, understood as the political sentiment of our time.\nThe conversations included the following triggering themes: the university in times of remote learning, inventive ways of doing extension when it is not possible to be “in the field”; the implications and challenges of conducting research during the current health crisis; and the creative process of the podcast as a UFC project. The 12 guests were undergraduate and graduate students from the UFC Psychology course. The podcast was carried out by undergraduate students and the advising professor from VIESES. We highlight that the search for a sound and visual aesthetic (posts to promote the podcast) that allowed for erasures, intervals, silences, and interruptions was an ethical-aesthetic-political bet against neoliberal and productivity-driven models in Brazilian higher education. Not only that, it was a way to inhabit the virtual territory in the face of the imminent massification of distance education strategies within the university as a horizon of control over teaching-learning processes.",

    "text": "1.6 Final Considerations\nThe above-listed communication products are contemporary productions that effectively address Psychology through collective and engaged technical production with social movements, productions that resonate their practices and impact the practice of Psychology, expanding content, debate, and involving communities, faculty, and students. Thus, modes of knowledge production are reinvented, encouraging and valuing practices that highlight challenges and impasses in the decolonization of Psychology (Miranda & Félix-Silva, 2022).\nThe creation of these technical productions, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of neo-fascist values and practices, started from the premise that addressing the multifaceted field of Human Rights through innovative strategies that broaden the reach and resonance of technical productions in Psychology is fundamental for promoting critical training in this area, linking undergraduate and graduate studies, ethically committed to transforming unequal realities in the Brazilian context, which still coexists with strong marks and practices of coloniality (Ballestrin, 2013; Lugones, 2014). To move against uncritical and reductionist approaches on the subject, the communication products could address realities and theoretical references of thinkers in Psychology and related fields that problematize cis-hetero-patriarchal-colonial-capitalist patterns (Silva et al., 2023).\nWe believe that these technical productions linked to VIESES are relevant for enhancing, strengthening, and stimulating reflections and experience reports on tackling inequalities, violence, and oppression in Brazil (Benicio et al., 2018). Furthermore, they have sought to contribute, within the scope of emergency remote teaching, to meeting society’s demands for elucidating sociopsychological aspects of violence and sharing successful experiences in defending human rights. These products have innovation potential, as they sought to create more interactive channels for discussion, re-elaboration, and dissemination of knowledge produced by VIESES-UFC research. The number of editions also shows the potential for replicating actions. The fact that the podcasts have been accessed by people in various countries shows their international reach. The articulations between undergraduate, graduate students, faculty, professionals, and members of social movements, as well as the need for the team to appropriate methods and techniques of curation, scripting, editing, and dissemination, demonstrate the high complexity of such technical productions.\nTherefore, it is believed that these communication products contribute to expanding the impact of the Graduate Program in Psychology at UFC on society by enhancing the resonances of discussions that have been dear to VIESES since its creation. This is because, with the podcasts, these problematizations could reach from undergraduate and graduate students to professionals, whether in Psychology or related fields, to public policy managers and members of collectives, social movements, and civil society organizations from different regions of Brazil and even beyond the national territory.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nMuch has been discussed about the apparent gap between scientific knowledge and society. During the pandemic1, and even before it, we observed a resurgence of anti-scientific manifestations such as anti-vaccine movements, the return of flat earth beliefs, and the use of unproven medications for disease treatment. Similarly, institutions producing academic knowledge, such as schools, universities, and scientific communicators, have not succeeded in maintaining a dialogue with society. Often, the language used does not facilitate communication, and the use of jargon incomprehensible to the majority of the “lay” population creates an insurmountable barrier for those outside the academic sphere. While technical teaching still prevails in the academic environment, transdisciplinarity and dialogue emerge as a way to bridge academic-scientific knowledge with reality, cultural experiences, and individuals’ knowledge, allowing for enrichment and learning fundamental for the improvement of both dimensions without denying their specificities.\nThis chapter aims to present aspects that traverse and compose the Polyphonies extension project, highlighting both its practices, which generally characterize as a technical production of the “Event Organization” type, and the main theoretical guidelines that underpin them. To this end, the chapter is subdivided into 2 sections, respectively:\nAt the end, besides concisely revisiting the discussed points, some challenges for improving Polyphonies activities are listed.",

    "section": "2.2 Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project",
    "text": "2.2 Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project\nPolyphonies is an extension project of the Federal University of Ceará – Sobral Campus, which is based on the importance of transversal, transdisciplinary, decolonized, and transformative teaching that transcends the university’s barriers. Only through the democratization of knowledge is it possible to contribute to mitigating vulnerabilities, training more ethical professionals aware of their responsibility to the general community, and ensuring that different social actors actively participate in knowledge production. Thus, Polyphonies’ main objective is to disseminate scientific and philosophical knowledge using simple and accessible language that facilitates the approach and dialogue between academic and non-academic audiences.\nAlthough it was registered with the Extension Pro-Rectory only in January 2020, the project originated from a meeting held on October 31, 2019, in the Mucambinho auditorium (UFC/Sobral). The event featured the participation of four PhD professors affiliated with UFC/Sobral to discuss the topic of “Time” from the perspectives of Music, with Dr. Adeline Stervinou; Physics, with Dr. João Guilherme Matias Nogueira; Engineering, with Dr. José Cláudio do Nascimento; and Anthropology, with Dr. Denise Silva. Despite the high level of the guests, they were asked to address the topic in a comprehensible and engaging way for an audience that included students and professors from various undergraduate and graduate courses. Each guest had between 10 and 15 minutes to speak, followed by an open session for audience comments and questions.\nThe event was very successful, with an estimated participation of 80 to 90 people, and it was evident that everyone (guests and audience) was interested in exchanging ideas and making transdisciplinary connections in a setting where informality and scientific rigor were perfectly balanced. Professors and students from seemingly different courses such as Music, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Psychology engaged in deep and productive dialogues, momentarily forgetting their supposed disciplinary separation. The event’s receptiveness was so strong that students, guests, and professors approached the organizers afterward to suggest other dialogue topics, demonstrating their desire for the activity’s continuity. Consequently, plans began to take shape to ensure the event’s regular occurrence and expand its reach beyond the university’s walls.\nOnce registered with the proper authorities, the project’s coordinators sought, in early March 2020, to establish a partnership with the Sobral Municipal Education Secretariat (SEDUC). The search for SEDUC was not random but reflected Polyphonies’ commitment to extending beyond the university audience, provoking debates where multiple perspectives on a topic could flow. According to the plan, guests and school communities in basic education would have the chance to jointly create an environment for exchanges where the rigid marking of power and knowledge places would be continuously challenged.\nSEDUC embraced the partnership proposal, understanding that it would bring to the municipality a relevant experience of transdisciplinary and dialogical practices in the regular school environment; a stimulus for studying subjects and curriculum content and academic reading through transdisciplinary topics that provoke logical and complex reasoning in an accessible manner, among other benefits. In return, the secretariat would assist in promoting the events within the school community, providing physical space and/or transportation to the event location, and financial support for publications derived from each meeting. However, on March 16, 2020, Sobral declared its first period of social isolation due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic, postponing the developing plans with SEDUC until the health situation returned to normal.\nIt was then up to the newly formed Polyphonies team – 2 coordinating professors and 6 undergraduate students – like many other activities in various sectors, to reinvent planned actions for in-person delivery while maintaining the project’s central aspects and ensuring everyone’s health and safety. Considering the available possibilities and existing examples, the group opted to hold meetings online. Social networks and their popularity among different audiences emerged as a potentially interesting tool for achieving the project’s goals under the imposed health scenario. The apparent simplicity of social networks, their reach, and the speed of content dissemination made them the primary source for promoting the 7 events that subsequently took place. Instagram, initially a photo-sharing social network, became for many a professional dissemination tool, for quick tutorials, and news. Thus, it was a virtual space suitable for the mobilizations and contacts desired by the project.\nThe Polyphonies project account on Instagram was created on May 30, 2020, as a place that gathered information about the project and its activities, also serving as a virtual interaction space with interested audiences, currently having 287 followers. Over time and with the team’s maturation, the page also became a receptacle for posts with suggestions for artistic productions (series, books, films, and music) related to the theme of the most recent event. The choice of art was justified as an effective, democratic, and inviting dissemination form for the general public, mainly because its language is open to diverse views and subjectivity (Gomes, 2020). Additionally, introducing art in dialogical mediation with the project’s audience generated an initially unexpected product: Clubefonias, an action that gathers people of different age groups and realities via WhatsApp to discuss a work chosen by the members in biweekly meetings.\nBesides the Instagram page and the Clubefonias WhatsApp group, the project created a YouTube channel in August 2020 that hosts the recorded events. On this widely accessible social network, 3 of the 7 organized meetings are available.\nOn June 16, 2020, the first virtual event took place via Google Meet, bringing together university professors with experience in Art, Philosophy, and Psychology and a representative of an African-based religion to discuss the theme “All Roads Lead to Knowledge.” The theme was chosen by the Polyphonies team to introduce the project’s proposal to the general public without appearing as a lecture and without imposing a limited way of thinking about knowledge. The idea was to indicate openness to dialogue and the project’s transdisciplinary nature through the event title. During registration for the “live,” participants were invited to suggest topics for future discussions, thus seeking to access their interests and realities. The event had 86 registrants, lasted 2 hours, and certificates were issued for guests and participants.\nA few days after the inaugural event, the project team met to collectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses to be improved in future actions. This moment proved essential and has since been incorporated into the extension group’s meeting schedule. As a result of these event analyses, some modifications or action guidelines were implemented: ensuring space for audience questions/comments within the event time; reducing the meeting duration from 2 hours to 1 hour, considering the excess of virtual activities since the pandemic; decreasing the number of guests to 2 per session; creating 3 guiding questions distributed to the guests upon invitation, facilitating communication between different perspectives and their connection to everyday concerns; rotating the student team members as event moderators, as this contributes to their professional development; intensifying event promotion via WhatsApp and other means to reach more people outside the university; changing the event’s name from “Round Table Discussion” to “Bar Talk.”\nThe choice of the name “Bar Talk” deserves special attention, as it is linked to understanding that the “role of scientific dissemination has evolved over time, following the development of science and technology” (Albagli, 1996). In times of fast communication and social networks, it was considered important to adapt the name to the type of event held by Polyphonies. While “Round Table Discussion” conveys a dialogical and informal disposition, it also carries the image of an academic action common within school and university walls. However, “Bar Talk” evokes a space not associated with the scientific universe, and thus, it not only highlights the informality of the conversation and dialogue but also suggests active participation where discussions are accessible and stimulating. By distancing the events from a scientific dissemination praxis characterized by the difficulties of transmitting knowledge that academic and scientific circles display, the project reinforces openness to dialogue with other types of audiences and the opportunity to engage with various topics. Thus, scientific dissemination assumes essential roles in democratizing scientific knowledge and, consequently, opens doors to scientific literacy, contributing to including citizens in specialized topic debates that, even without many knowing, are intrinsically linked to and influence their lives (Bueno, 2010), as well as adding to the education of so-called ‘intellectuals’ by giving them the chance to expand/exercise new languages and articulations from their expertise.\nIt is worth noting that the internal meetings of the Polyphonies team, held biweekly on Fridays, are important not only due to the “technical” decisions that arise from them. In fact, the group’s meetings have served as a way to foster light and creative connections among participants, as most members did not have the chance to strengthen bonds in person, given that the pandemic began shortly after they joined the team. Approaching people virtually was the main challenge faced by the project, but the group’s internal experience has been a successful example of how dialogical thinking and practice combined with transdisciplinarity are potent for building humanized and enriching social bonds.\nBetween March 16, 2020, and August 2021, when this chapter was written, Polyphonies conducted 7 events, bringing together 298 participants, including 16 guests (11 from academic backgrounds and 5 from non-academic backgrounds). In addition to the topic of the first meeting, already described, the subjects addressed were: Pandemic and family relationships; Contemporary work relationships; Art and social transformation; Fake news and its impacts on society; Social movements; Language – Norms, power, and social transformations. These themes, whenever possible, took into account the suggestions presented by the audience during event registration. To date, the project has recorded 17 topics brought by participants.\nDespite this predominantly informative and practical description of the Polyphonies project, it is only possible to truly understand it by illuminating, albeit briefly, the theoretical and ethical pillars underlying its actions. This is the purpose of the next section.",

    "section": "2.3 Theoretical and Ethical Pillars of Polyphonies",
    "text": "2.3 Theoretical and Ethical Pillars of Polyphonies\n\n2.3.1 Transdisciplinarity\nTransdisciplinarity is understood as what is, at the same time, between, through, and beyond any discipline. The term, according to Guedes (2010), was first used by Piaget in 1970 but was only formalized in 1994 with the document “Charter of Transdisciplinarity” at the First World Congress in Portugal. Transdisciplinarity seeks to “transgress the logic of non-contradiction, articulating opposites: subject and object, subjectivity and objectivity, matter and consciousness, simplicity and complexity, unity and diversity” (Nicolescu, 1999; Santos, 2008). In other words, transdisciplinarity understands that reality can be viewed integratively, blurring the boundaries between forms of knowledge and asserting that the whole – reality – is highly complex and integrated, and the parts – sciences, for instance – actively communicate and sustain each other. This approach breaks with the fixed and timeless idea of dichotomies, understanding them as interactive agents that must be considered from the relationships they establish among themselves. Thus, Santos (2008) states that “the understanding of reality ascends to another level, taking on a broader meaning and always open to new processes” (p. 5).\nA serious analysis of the history of science reveals the transdisciplinary dimension of science, as scientific knowledge and society are intimately intertwined. The formation and consolidation of science point to a specific way of responding to society’s questions and needs (Videira, 2004).\nBeyond this social rootedness, which shows that science is not external to the world, it is important to apply the transdisciplinary perspective to the very structure of science. While the departmentalization of science allows for undeniable advances through highly specialized studies, discoveries in each field and subfield of knowledge need to be repositioned within the complex web of reality that is not abstractly fragmented into study fields. In this sense, it is fundamental to recognize scientific knowledge as constituted by diverse professionals with diverse knowledges that relate and intersect. Thus, transdisciplinarity, by not disregarding the complex aspects of reality and valuing its multiplicity, enhances dialogue between science and society and between different spheres of scientific knowledge.\nFrom this perspective, Martinazzo (2020) suggests that transdisciplinarity is a better path to understanding a complex and multidimensional reality, as it uses mechanisms that enable adaptation to this multiplicity. Transdisciplinarity, by considering both the complex and the simple to comprehend reality, allows various fields to be contemplated in knowledge as they articulate in the world, making room for opposing ideas to be considered and for all fields of knowledge to exercise their importance.\nTransdisciplinarity aims to overcome the closed universe produced by science by bringing forth the multiplicity of knowledge production modes and recognizing the importance of reintegrating the subject into the scientific observation process, given the strong interdependence between the observer, the observation process, and the observed object (Martinazzo, 2020, p. 7).\nThus, transdisciplinarity, in its pursuit of knowledge reintegration and the subject’s participation in scientific production, also facilitates the broader dissemination of knowledge, especially in societies where knowledge diffusion is often hindered by social inequalities, highlighting the elitist nature of knowledge access in these cultures. Indeed, this rapprochement is built because transdisciplinary practice strengthens the democratization of scientific knowledge by considering that this knowledge is produced for society and recognizing that non-scientific knowledge is relevant for understanding the world. Additionally, transdisciplinarity is linked to scientific dissemination, as it adapts to the complex and multidimensional reality, values contextualization, and creates an environment where divergent ideas and practices have the opportunity to be confronted respectfully and rigorously. Thus, transdisciplinarity fosters the dialogue essential for democratizing knowledge and genuinely democratic and free societies.\nHaving outlined the qualities and potentials of transdisciplinarity, the question remains: how can we promote transdisciplinary practices from the Brazilian university setting?\nClues to answering this question lie in the previously mentioned definition of transdisciplinarity, indicating the need to flexibilize knowledge boundaries through an integrated understanding of reality. Based on this, for scientific knowledge dissemination to occur, it is essential to devise strategies that ensure the traversal of physical and social barriers to knowledge access without neglecting the inherent possibilities of contemporary technologies. This is the arena where the Polyphonies Project operates with its events and actions.\nThe project’s actions aim to address various contemporary issues from a contextualized and multifaceted perspective, understanding that even the simplest topic carries a multiplicity of information studied from plural theoretical and practical perspectives. Because they are plural, they can be approached from different references, giving the topic a transdisciplinary character. Let’s take the first event, “All Roads Lead to Knowledge,” as an example. As mentioned earlier, the meeting featured 4 guests, including 3 university professors (linked to Art, Psychology, and/or Philosophy) and a religious representative. On this occasion, each guest spoke about a type of knowledge related to their field (Art, Philosophy, Science, and Religion), highlighting not only their specificities but also their relationships with the other represented spheres. The event’s transdisciplinary goal was successful, as the intertwined speeches of the guests effectively broke the traditional barriers between those knowledge fields, and the audience’s participation through comments and questions gave/amplified the meaning of what was discussed while simultaneously glimpsing interaction points in the diverse speakers’ discourses. In this first activity, the strength and, consequently, the need for transdisciplinary practices in scientific and non-scientific fields became evident as tools for enhancing the dissemination of knowledge integrated with society.\n\n\n2.3.2 Scientific Dissemination\nDiscussing scientific dissemination requires revisiting a few centuries to consider the very act of doing science. As highlighted by Moreira (2002, Novembro 14-15), the known scientific revolution occurred in the mid-17th century, influenced by various sociodemographic factors, bringing to the forefront many thinkers who are now scientific references, such as Kepler and Galileo. However, despite the growing recognition of scientific relevance and the development of technologies that expanded access to intellectual products, science remains in the hands of specific and small groups – albeit significantly larger and more diverse than in previous centuries – while most of the population remains ignorant of the scientific and technological knowledge production processes underlying the presented ways of life.\nAs previously mentioned, despite the many knowledge produced within research centers and university academies, their connection with the external public leaves much to be desired. The dissemination of what is produced usually does not reach those outside the scientific sphere, even though this seems to occur unintentionally, as nothing indicates that researchers are interested in this segregation. The problem of poor knowledge distribution has already concerned Lima Vaz (2000), who emphasized:\n\nThe great scientific revolutions of our century, while propelling technical progress, make the understanding of deep theoretical connections between scientific thought and technical practice more enigmatic to the common man, user of the objects that technology offers for his consumption and satisfaction. (p. 278).\n\nOne consequence of this poor knowledge distribution can be seen in today’s anti-scientific movements, which, using resources that only exist due to the development of science and technology, propagate distorted and false information that fuels unfounded conspiracy theories with potentially devastating effects in politics, health, economy, environment, etc.\nThis reveals the urgency of rethinking the ways in which scientific knowledge dissemination has occurred – or failed to occur. More than ever, creating spaces where science and society can interact fluidly is essential. A fluid interaction capable of effectively disseminating academic knowledge requires always remembering that the audience addressed by the knowledge will consist of “lay” people. This implies considering not only the dissemination medium but also the language used.\nTraditionally, sciences adopt a discourse type aimed at knowledge diffusion to a restricted audience. Thus, scientific communication among peers does not usually need to make concessions in its specialized discourse, as despite using restricted language, it finds its primary interlocutor in a very specific audience familiar with that vocabulary and data presentation form. However, when aiming to expand beyond those groups versed in academic jargon, scientists and intellectuals usually act believing, as Bueno (2010) points out, “that their audience shares the same concepts and that technical jargon constitutes common heritage” (p. 3). However, presuming that the chosen words for the discourse already carry specific meanings and functions cannot be dissociated from the notion that these meanings and functions take shape through contact with the listener. Therefore, in contact with individuals outside the scientific environment, words requiring a conception restricted to researchers’ circles do not convey meanings (Authier-Revuz, 2015) and undermine the dissemination effort.\nIn this context, Polyphonies aims to practice scientific dissemination, understanding it as a process of recoding specialized discourse to make content accessible to a broad audience (Bueno, 2010), an effort to translate and decode information shaped in academic-scientific codes and jargon into more familiar language understandable by the scientifically uneducated public (Bueno, 2010). The project assumes that knowledge dissemination is appropriate in “any activity of explaining and spreading knowledge, culture, and scientific and technical thought, under two conditions: outside official or equivalent education and without the aim of training specialists” (Marandino et al., 2003, p. 5), and, based on this, proposes a colloquial conversation among different actors related to the selected event theme. In this interaction, driven by questions previously sent to the guests, researchers, practitioners (professionals, social movement participants, etc.), and the public have the chance to adjust and expand their different vocabularies, collectively weaving a glossary that harmonizes theories, practices, and experiences. Thus, the commitment to scientific dissemination results in a commitment to dialogue as a core pillar of Polyphonies.\n\n\n2.3.3 Dialogue\nWith the idea of dialogism, Mikhail Bakhtin shed light on the dialogical interactions that constitute and are woven between discourses, asserting that the dialogical relationship is constitutive of language (Marcuzzo, 2008; Rechdan, 2003). According to him, humans must always be seen in their relationship with others, as “it is impossible to think of a person outside the relationships that bind them to others” (Faraco, 1996, as cited in Marcuzzo, 2008, p. 4). Thus, the dialogical dimension is not only present in language and discourses but continuously traverses our identity. Despite this foundational intertwining that links self and other, establishing dialogical relationships where one voice does not submit to others is not guaranteed a priori. Here, the notion of polyphony comes into play, pointing to a dialogical movement where “different social voices … confront each other, clash, manifesting different social viewpoints on a given object …” (Rechdan, 2003, p. 46). This concept aptly names the project: Polyphonies activities mobilize diverse social voices, creating an environment where distinct discourses have the opportunity to cross and consciously redraw themselves, recognizing their identities are not static or independent of their connection to the other.\nAs seen in the transdisciplinarity section, the project embraces the notion that knowledge construction operates multiply and constantly, encompassing different aspects that are shaped, transformed, or cease to be validated as they relate. This aligns with the idea that reality is complex, i.e., it does not have only one level, one side, one knowledge, all comprehensible definitively. From this angle, the hierarchicalization of knowledge or certain areas as less or more important loses a priori significance, as the engine and validation of knowledge are understood as inseparable from the flow of knowledge, experiences, and consequences at play.\nPolyphonies’ journey seeks to keep in mind that not only reality but also the individuals inhabiting and composing it are complex. Thus, in pursuing its commitment to having a transformative effect on the world, the project considers individuals as bearers of histories, experiences, and worldviews (Lucena et al., 2016). Accordingly, Paulo Freire (2008) is an indispensable reference, understanding that “dialogue is, in itself, creative and re-creative” [and that] “dialogue seals the act of learning, which is never individual, although it has an individual dimension” (pp. 13-14). Adopting Freire’s view, Polyphonies strives to convene, through dialogue, individuals as creative subjects endowed with unique riches, whose action/inaction impacts reality. By embedding dialogue as a core part of its activities, the project reinforces the idea that knowledge is a product of the collective of subjects who, consciously or not, invent and reinvent the world.\nTherefore, considering scientific dissemination through dialogical lenses reaffirms the previously discussed need to subvert conventional relationships with language to create diverse spaces where words make sense for everyone. This task is especially challenging in a country with high social inequality and income concentration, requiring serious consideration that in formal lectures, congresses, or even classrooms, the language used can include or exclude subjects who have historically had their knowledge denied and erased by the imposition of a hegemonic culture, including scientific theories and institutions.\nChauí (2002) invites us to take the next step, recalling that “democracy brings to the fore the problem of violence, that is, the reduction of the subject to the condition of a thing” (p. 68). In other words, by adopting dialogue as a form of scientific dissemination, Polyphonies is not simply concerned with the cosmetic dimension of language, making it palatable and accessible to those outside the academic milieu. More than that, the project’s events aim to value the myriad ways individuals produce, signify, and narrate cultures and knowledge.\nThus, Polyphonies’ actions counter a ‘colonizing mission,’ whose project was to homogenize the world, obliterating cultural differences. Through deeply anti-democratic and anti-dialogical colonization, much social experience was wasted, and the world’s epistemological, cultural, and political diversity was reduced. Those who managed to survive colonizing advances were subjected to the dominant epistemological norm (Santos, 2008).\nBy establishing dialogue as an inescapable guideline for its activities, Polyphonies acknowledges the existence of a coloniality of knowledge and positions itself against it. Admitting that speech implies power relations means not shying away from repeatedly asking: Who speaks? To whom does one speak? About what does one speak? How does one speak? Which discursive practices are being denied, and which are being legitimized? Whom does this discourse serve?\nAsking these questions and being committed to revisiting them regularly outlines the project’s ethical horizon, prompting its members to continually think of ways to create spaces where knowledge can circulate dialogically, where all voices matter, and where scientific dissemination is effective precisely because the walls separating scientific knowledge from popular knowledge can be collectively redrawn.",

    "section": "2.4 Final Considerations",
    "text": "2.4 Final Considerations\nThe Polyphonies Extension Project, through transdisciplinary and dialogical practices, seeks to disseminate scientific knowledge beyond the university, thus breaking down walls and the hierarchy of knowledge. Its activities are guided by transdisciplinarity, gaining even more strength through dialogue, which aids in the development and conduct of events, making them accessible to the general public and constructing the project collaboratively. The project’s actions focus on knowledge dissemination, understanding it as a process collectively gestated from the encounter of different subjects who have the opportunity to hear and be heard. In this sense, it can be said that Polyphonies’ ultimate goal is to contribute to social transformation by fostering and encouraging the invention of complex, rooted, and relevant knowledge addressing the issues affecting the various actors and contexts shaping societies.\nThus, the events organized by the project reflect its interest in dialogue and contact with the other, marked in their names. “Polyphonies,” “Bar Talks,” and “Clubefonia” remove the rigidity with which scientific information is typically approached, giving rise to relaxed and potent conversations, precisely because they are more than “information transfer” venues. The audience is not seen as passive; on the contrary, their thoughts, cultures, and knowledge are incorporated into the dialogue to broaden the contact and understanding of reality. Therefore, it is valid to say that Polyphonies works with the plurality of voices, ideas, people, cultures, and knowledge. Driven by the possibility of viewing the world through a transdisciplinary lens, the project seeks to learn, express, and foster this vision through its actions.\nHowever, there are challenges and room for improvement. Among the challenges, the Polyphonies team is dedicated to finding strategies to “break the bubble,” that is, to increasingly mobilize the participation of people outside the university who have access to the project and its events. In this endeavor, the group is organizing to promote the project itself through various social media (Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.), emphasizing its interest in an audience with diverse educational levels, backgrounds, and social roles.\nAnother challenge is imposed by the limitations of the virtual event environment. While it enables breaking physical barriers by bringing together individuals from different cities, it also restricts the intensity of possible interactions, particularly affecting the dialogue with the participating audience, which tends to be more passive in this scenario.\nAware of these and other difficulties, Polyphonies remains committed to its goal of enabling knowledge exchange and re-establishing the long-lost connection between science and society through its actions, bringing the community to a new place: that of a knowledge builder, thus contributing to scientific dissemination.",

    "title": "3  Possible Contagions: Creating Spaces for an Anti-Asylum Psychology",
    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 What Moves Thought to Think\nThe work we present here originates from our commitment to building a society without asylums. From a Deleuzian perspective that “more important than thought is what ‘gives one to think’…” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 89), we were driven by this struggle to create devices that articulated what was experienced in contact with our field of intervention, namely a Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS), and the production and dissemination of knowledge, in an attempt to invent spaces, beyond academic activity, that enable the deconstruction of the stigma of madness.\nThe production of knowledge constructed in/through immersion in the field relies on the perspective of the tension that the insertion of bodies in a given territory exerts, as it drives the construction of new knowledge, practices, and experiments. Referencing cartography as a research method and access to reality, according to Barros and Kastrup (2009), the cartographer opens up to the movement of a territory and unravels variables of a production process in this contact.\nIn this sense, the experience of organizing an event in honor of the National Day of the Anti-Asylum Struggle emerges as a significant technical production, enabling reflection on constructing engaged and embodied knowledge that extends beyond classrooms and academic walls. Organized by the PASÁRGADA group: Promotion of Art, Health, and Guarantee of Rights, linked to the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), Fortaleza campus, in partnership with the substitute service, other groups, and social movements, the Anti-Asylum Week, held in 2022, constituted an event aiming to engage the community in defending care in freedom, based on the need to irradiate a new social vision affirming madness in the sphere of coexistence, with free circulation in the city’s fabric.\nIn this venture, we started with a perspective that conceives defending the rights of people in psychological distress as a social transformation project that goes beyond the physical extinction of asylums and all societal mechanisms of exclusion and silencing of madness, understanding that “the asylum issue echoes far beyond the psychiatric hospital walls or the strict domain of asylum practices, extending throughout the social fabric” (Prado Filho & Lemos, 2020, p. 55). In other words, the production of this event stems from the idea that resisting the asylum system requires contaminating the streets, challenging the thoughts of those entrenched in oppressive and exclusionary perspectives on madness and difference.\nWith Deleuze (2003), we learned that “without something that forces one to think, without something that violates thought, it means nothing” (p. 89). Thus, to provoke thought beyond what is prescribed by common sense, it is necessary to create a state of strangeness, always involuntary, that breaks the mere recognition of the external world, which is provoked by signs: “what forces us to think is the sign. The sign is the object of an encounter; but it is precisely the contingency of the encounter that guarantees the necessity of what it makes us think” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 91).\nThinking is, therefore, an activity triggered involuntarily under the violence of encountering signs, which should not be confused with signifiers, as signs have no pre-given meaning to be recognized. Instead, “the sign implies in itself heterogeneity as a relation” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 21), so every sign implies an opening of worlds that affects us in such a way as to push our faculties beyond their usual limits. Thus, the sign is directly affective, and thinking originates from affection. This is particularly important to us as it provides the necessary openness to conceive the production of knowledge as an intensive and bodily experience, far from a recognitive attitude.\nWhat we advocate here is that thinking does not start from something pre-established but from production through sensitivities. Our challenge, therefore, was to enable intensive encounters through signs that affirmed the production and propagation of knowledge as a sensitive and engaged experience. More than that, we know that the sign, as an affect, is effective in constructing other worlds incompatible with the established (Nascimento, 2012), so the centrality of our initiative was linked to creating disturbance spaces that, by force of the encounter, tensioned the place of madness in the social body and infected others with the idea of care in freedom.\nThus, we proposed an event that constitutes a technical production aimed at constructing an anti-asylum psychology. This initiative is especially necessary during setbacks in Brazil’s national mental health policy, resulting from the approval of a series of political projects contrary to the ideals of a society free from asylums, whether mental or structural. Given this scenario, we argue that it is more necessary than ever to provoke thought about madness and mental health care, preparing the ground for creating other ways of relating to difference.\nWe also remember that the persistence of an asylum logic within the substitute services is one of the major challenges faced by the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS), often originating in the formative processes of health professionals who fail to deconstruct the relations of domination and chronification of users typical of asylum models. To resist this, we created an innovative product, resulting from our interventions and studies on mental health care, which places the affection and contagion of reality as premises for producing and disseminating knowledge in times of tension and dispute in this field. Below, we will share some of the construction of this event, which was, above all, an experiment in knowledge produced with the other.",

    "text": "3.2 Affecting and Moving: Inventing the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Week”\nThe Anti-Asylum Struggle Week initiative results from studies on mental health care and the continued insertion that the PASÁRGADA program has had in this field since 2019. Through university extension, the group has developed activities in two Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS) - Type II in Fortaleza-CE. These actions include therapeutic group follow-ups, activities in the services’ waiting rooms, and actions beyond these facilities’ walls.\nSuch interventions rely on art as a device that enables fluidity of expression in its various forms and expands communicative notions by transcending language through senses that pulse beyond speech. Deleuze and Guattari (2010) affirm that “art wants to create a finite that restores the infinite: it traces a composition plan that carries, in turn, monuments or composed sensations, under the action of aesthetic figures” (p. 253). In this sense, the inventiveness characteristic of this device allows access to a given content that transcends the artist, the work, and the subject who visualizes it, dimensioning a vibrant reality proposing new ways of accessing life aesthetically and sensitively.\nWith this perspective, we understand that art is not limited to a humanizing tool for care, as it is also a resource that offers, through experimentation, new subjective anchors for people in psychological distress, giving them the possibility to reinvent themselves and the world. As Costa, Zanella, and Fonseca (2016) point out, art influences the composition of overflows of the established limits imposed on research, intervention, and existence. Thus, it arises for us as a form of resistance to the hegemonic ways of living imposed on madness, affirming a process of expanding the fields it can inhabit, whether concrete – in this case, social – or subjective. Therefore, our alliance with art is also made from an ethical and political struggle perspective, linked to overcoming psychiatric and asylum institutions, which have gained strength in recent years.\nDue to the social isolation situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, care provided in CAPS was mainly limited to psychiatric and psychological care and medication distribution, given the impossibility of conducting collective activities such as therapeutic and operative groups in person. Consequently, a scenario favorable to advancing outpatient and medicalizing care logic was cultivated in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network before the pandemic crisis (Guimarães & Sampaio, 2016), but which severely worsened during this context, implying a significant setback for psychiatric reform and the anti-asylum project, already greatly weakened by the advance of neoliberalism and conservatism in the country.\nThe vision of constructing the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event arose from the loosening of sanitary measures and the return of in-person activities in early 2022. It also emerges from the memory that constitutes PASÁRGADA, which, in its years of existence, has conducted various actions stitching together health services, universities, social movements, and society. Crossed by what Deleuze (1992) asserts when he says “a little bit of possible, otherwise I suffocate…” (p. 131), we are called to re-enchant May 18 in a context of psychological, social, and political fragility, as well as setbacks in psychiatric reform and uncertainty regarding the reality we once knew and are called to inhabit again after the COVID-19 calamity.\nIt is worth noting that the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day reflects a series of disputes and the active participation of the community, workers, families, and people in psychological distress. Espírito Santo, Araújo, and Amarante (2016) state that, from the emergence of the Mental Health Workers Movement (MTSM) in the 1970s, denunciations against the treatment model then used as a reference in the mental health field reverberated. The strictly biomedical perspective, along with reports of violence against the bodies inhabiting so-called care spaces, described an unsustainable situation, resulting in the 8th National Health Conference and, a year later, the First National Mental Health Conference. The emergency and change scenario produced during the second MTSM congress in 1987 established May 18 as a symbolic date for maintaining and engaging in a rights struggle, care in freedom, and de-asyluming life.\nAmarante and Nunes (2018) highlight that during the occasion, the slogan “For a society without asylums” was created, and the social movement became more complex, gaining participation from new social actors (users, families, and other human rights activists). Additionally, a new horizon of demand was built, focused on deconstructing the asylum logic and its institutional apparatus, thus constituting itself as the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Movement (MLA).” According to the authors:\n\nA decisive element for this expansion [of the MLA] was the creation of the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day in Bauru. May 18 would serve to awaken critical thinking in society about the institutional violence of psychiatry and the exclusion of people in psychological distress. It can be considered that the objective was successful to the extent that, since then, political, scientific, cultural, and social activities have been carried out not only on the day in question but throughout the month of May, which came to be considered the Anti-Asylum Struggle Month. Given the significant repercussion of the events organized by the MLA and their substantial participation in broader health issues, the term “mentalistas” (in reference to heavy metal) became widely used to characterize the “noise” caused by this social actor (Amarante & Nunes, 2018, p. 2070).\n\nThus, given the importance of this date, guided by the construction of comprehensive care, in freedom and integration (in the network), we questioned how to create crossings that could disrupt what is rigid in psychosocial care and continue the proposal of care that transcends the service structure. The challenges arise from the intersection of a moment of collective mourning, physical reinsertion into previously uninhabited spaces, and significant sensitization regarding mental health and social ties. Therefore, we are called to challenge the established and bet on inventiveness and affection as mobilizing forces, creating the 2022 Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event.\nThis event featured diverse activities distributed over five days, namely:\n\nMonday: a procession through Benfica and a discussion circle at the university.\nTuesday: an action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV and a panel discussion at the university.\nWednesday: participation in the public act promoted by the Ceará Anti-Asylum Struggle Forum (FCLA) in the city center.\nThursday: organization of an exhibition; and\nFriday: in-person display of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” exhibition at São José Theater.\n\nThe construction and implementation of this venture were only possible thanks to the alliances built with partner institutions and professionals, users, social movements, university sectors, and a range of agencies that, according to Deleuze and Guattari (2003), “… extend or penetrate an unlimited field of immanence that melts segments, freeing desire from all its concretions and abstractions, or at least actively struggles against them to dissolve them” (p. 145). Thus, we sought to create crossings that brought movement to the crystallized practices in the mental health field.\nThe event began on May 16, Monday, with a procession through the streets of Benfica, a neighborhood with a high flow of people and the location of the UFC Psychology Department. The act was carried out alongside the carnival block “Doido é Tu!”. This moment aimed to compose a struggle that arises from alliances and through boundary transgression, proposing a contagion with the city, the university, art, and culture, weaving the struggle for ethical-political care. As Martins (2009) points out, “in anti-asylum practices, the city, madness, and art meet and together make an appeal for life. They demand less life to be lived and more pulsating life…” (p. 86).\nThe procession emitted notes that vibrated through the city, prompting passing cars to honk and pedestrians to shout with us, through a porosity that permeated boundaries. We took flight, sang, walked, danced, shouted, and landed. The act ended at the Moreira Campos Forest, located in the Center for Humanities I at UFC, where we gathered and settled for a discussion circle titled “Anti-Asylum Struggles: Still!”. This location was purposely chosen, as it has a high flow of people moving daily, potentially engaging with the proposed discussion.\nWe aimed to enter the university by shattering crystallizations regarding madness and seeking to broaden this debate not only within a course focused on mental health, such as Psychology, but for society as a whole. In agreement with the Basaglian perspective, we proposed to discuss the possibility of inventing new strategies for restructuring cultural organization regarding the presence of the subject in distress and the disturbance they determine, producing other modes of expressing this experience of suffering (Basaglia, 2010).\nSettling visibly to passersby, singing, dancing, dialoguing, and inquiring: can madness occupy the university? In this composition between passing flows, the large circle included users and service professionals, professors, and students from various university courses. It was realized through the collective space of sharing and discussing the history of the Anti-Asylum Struggle and Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, its processes and setbacks, and the need to maintain it today.\nAt this moment, the struggle was tensioned as pluralized, as it is also an anti-racist, anti-LGBTQUIAP+phobic, and anti-fascist struggle, configuring itself as a demand for care that promotes quality of life for the bodies occupying this space. Basaglia (1985), analyzing the condition of the institutionalized, places the subject in psychological distress as a subject without rights, subjected to institutional powers, socially excluded due to their social and economic condition rather than the illness itself. Stela do Patrocínio (2009), a Black poet interned for almost 30 years, tells us that “being interned is being imprisoned all day” (p. 47), thus the asylum being a strategy for controlling and imprisoning bodies, mainly Black and poor. Therefore, it is crucial to think of mental health care that is provided in freedom and intersectionalized, recognizing the identity markers placed in the field of subordination, producing illnesses and new forms of the asylum.\nOn the second day of the event, we organized a morning action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV. This activity is a standard practice of Pasárgada since its insertion in health facilities, during waiting times for appointments or medication, for example. We propose interactive activities, provocative installations, and interventions that move the bodies present, aiming to subvert the outpatient logic marking this waiting time. Furthermore, aligning with Deleuze’s (1999, 27 de junho) association between art and resistance, we aim to construct other possibilities for life production through the contact between the device and mental health.\nUnderstanding the possibility of constructing possible paths of life, other creations for existence, the activity had the key question “What do we do to be free?”, with pens, colored pencils, markers, glue, colorful glue, and images, as well as a poster on an easel for producing a collective work from this trigger. The objective was to think about what freedom meant to each person, what affected them in this sense, and how it could be understood expansively and collectively, understanding the processes of subjectivation and the ways existence weaves itself beyond the neoliberal and individualistic ideal. The action was planned as care involved in not individualizing users, proposing, instead, a process of constructing collective resistances against systematic oppressions that attempt to suffocate difference, through forming alliances as a possible bet in the care in freedom experimentation process.\nAdditionally, in the afternoon, a panel discussion was held at the Center for Humanities II at UFC, proposed by VIESES (Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation Group), in partnership with FCLA, with support from PASÁRGADA, titled “Mental Health Care in Ceará: Concerns and Propositions.” The panel discussion focused on the mental health of children and adolescents and their current challenges; necropolitics and its impacts on mental health; and political disputes surrounding care for alcohol and other drug users. We understood this space as an opportunity to provoke critical academic thought about the reality of mental health in Ceará today, articulating different social actors from various contexts.\nThe setbacks in mental health policies highlighted by Passarinho (2022) when discussing government funding of therapeutic communities and psychiatric hospitals in the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS) emerged in this moment through the voices of workers and users. Moreover, the poor management of worker care, alongside the scarcity of public contests in this field – strategies for strengthening the bond between professionals and users through the permanence in the service – was highlighted as a central tool for proposing ethical care.\nThe disregard for children and adolescents’ mental health due to lack of incentive and the policy of youth mortification marked by race, gender, and socioeconomic status was another emphasized topic. The logic of making live and letting die that promotes life only for bodies considered normal was evident at this moment through the reports brought by those involved in this network, corroborating Mbembe’s (2018) notion that, “in the economy of biopower, the function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and make possible the murderous functions of the State” (p. 18).\nFurthermore, it was stated that the lack of incentive for harm reduction policy in favor of prohibitionist logics perpetuating the dynamics in the field of assistance to alcohol and other drug users chronifies the problem and reproduces asylum and violence practices. Harm reduction promotes a joint construction for experiences with psychoactive substances involving participation in policy management in the field and the reduction or even cessation of drug use (E. H. Passos & Souza, 2011). The panel discussion discussing these three axes raised many concerns and brought propositions around what was discussed, aiming to take the highlighted points to conferences and forums, contributing to public policy planning.\nOn the third day of action promotion, May 18, 2022, we made an ethical-political commitment to be in the street, participating in the act organized and led by FCLA and mobilizing the academic community to join this activity. The concentration for the political demonstration for care in freedom took place at Praça do Ferreira, in the city center, to create new visibility zones for madness, as Silva (2006) points out, the place is historically marked by\n\n… significant social content, constituting itself, over the years, as an “icon” for Fortaleza. A traditional meeting and sociability place, it was an excellent leisure space, still today the square of greatest representation in the center. The great vitality that takes place there becomes noticeable through cultural events, social manifestations, and the persistence of some uses that have been resisting the transformations in that public space. (p. 106)\n\nAmarante (2007) states that there is a sociocultural dimension in the Brazilian psychiatric reform process that is strategic in attempting to provoke the social imaginary through questioning about madness, mental illness, and psychiatric hospitals, based on the cultural and artistic production of social actors composing this movement. In this sense, historically, as mentioned above, May 18 and the following days mark social, cultural, and political movements with the participation of users, professionals, and families to claim and guarantee rights, care policies, and occupy the city for the anti-asylum struggle.\nThus, being on the street, occupying the city with art, music, dance, and slogans, is necessary. Inhabiting this territory as a meeting point, with bodies denied access to public space, is a process of affirming difference. Being there, professionals, users, families, students, politicians, and militants, is a bet on destabilizing what is set in macro-politics and the asylum structure, announcing our presence as a demand for the right to the city. Additionally, persisting as a group gathering on this date, amid a challenging political scenario – especially concerning public health – constitutes a collective construction of care and an ethical-political commitment to the anti-asylum agenda that must be strengthened. We also emphasize that participating in this act highlights the perspective of knowledge not only produced within university walls theoretically but also constructed through experimentation with the social actors involved and their life contexts.\nAgain, the carnival block “Doido é tu!” was present, enhancing this moment with music and dances. We produced posters, raised flags, and walked together to the headquarters of the Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat, where a letter written by FCLA listing and demanding points for effective care in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network was delivered.\nOn May 19, we focused on organizing and assembling our final action for that Week, which was characterized by the in-person exhibition of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” project. Thus, on May 20, we had this exhibition in partnership with CAPS II - CORES IV in Fortaleza. The idea for this action emerged from the desire to echo this artistic presentation, which initially took place virtually, with production starting in 2021, when the idea was proposed to one of the art therapy groups to create and organize works for an exhibition, culminating in 2022. The objective was to think and create an exhibition together with the artist and the group users, constructing a collective exhibition from the activities proposed in the group, resulting in the arts, the theme of the exhibition, the website, and the curatorial process.\nDespite the difficulties of constructing a care process through hybrid contact amid a pandemic, the virtual exhibition opened on February 16, 2022, with the website’s launch alongside the artists in a discussion circle via Google Meet, and closed on March 16, 2022. Thus, primarily proposing a relationship transforming Western society’s relationship with madness (Amarante, 1994), we brought the exhibition to the in-person format at São José Theater in Fortaleza, concluding the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week.\nSão José Theater, the chosen exhibition site, was created in 1914 and is a historic facility in Fortaleza, located in the city center, representing a significant cultural hub. Recently renovated after years of closure, it now features an important cultural program for the city. Thus, the choice of the theater stemmed from our previously stated desire to occupy the urban space in highly trafficked locations.\nThe works composing the in-person exhibition were the same as those in the virtual exhibition but with a different configuration, featuring interactive frames made by the artist-users with materials like bottle caps, sequins, threads, glitter, and even seeds. Additionally, all works were suspended with colorful strings, proposing movement with bodies beyond manual touch with the materialities. The room was arranged so visitors could follow a path starting with reception and information about the exhibition’s construction and leading to an installation with two projectors: one displaying audiovisual works and the other showing strictly visual works, all produced in the group space.\nThere were also some artistic installations proposing reflections on themes intersecting the mental health field. A mirror installation with the famous phrase “up close, nobody is normal,” from Caetano Veloso’s song “Vaca Profana,” invited people to interact and photograph themselves. Another installation, “How to Become Uncompressed? II,” by Caio Prado, in a corner, invited people to interact by discarding empty medication blister packs, prompting reflections on the medicalization of life. Finally, we organized a collective creation space where visitors could overflow the affections of this encounter. We placed poster boards on an easel before the room exit, providing paint, colored pens, threads, and glue for composing a materiality consisting of writings, drawings, and interventions by passersby after the visit.\nThroughout the day, over 100 people visited the exhibition, including the artists and their families, users from other CAPS in Fortaleza, such as those from CAPS AD in Regional IV, health professionals, public university students, private college students, high school institutions, technical courses, and many curious individuals. The purpose was to give visibility to the artists and their works, as there was a desire in the group to exhibit, and many had never had the opportunity, while also considering how art holds an essential place of possibility when it comes to mental health care and the de-stigmatization of these individuals, positioning the city as a point of involvement.\nCities, beyond buildings, houses, and intertwined streets producing materiality, are also stages for affections and social relations (Mansano, 2016). By understanding the city as this place of intertwining, we also understand that it is where life, encounters, and discussions are produced. Madness, long imprisoned – from the 17th century, as Foucault (1975) mentions, saying that madness entered this world of exclusion by an ideal of incapacity and reconstruction of the social space of the time – must also be intertwined in this city. Going out into the world implies, therefore, a form of resistance to these historical policies of exclusion, violence, and stigmatization of these bodies.",

    "text": "3.3 Final Considerations\nPassos et al. (2021) point out that the country is advancing towards a process of (re)asylumization driven by the interest of actors representing a conservative and neoliberal political project centered on maintaining privileges and focused on privatizations and the revival of social control practices. Therefore, we observe the importance of events like the one proposed for producing materiality seen, touched, and felt, as well as for producing sensitization, reflection, and debates on the anti-asylum agenda, acting on the de-stigmatization of madness and proposing care produced in freedom.\nA Psychology that aims to be Anti-Asylum must seek, within the University, to produce knowledge articulated with the proposition of new ethical and political horizons, seeking to combat this scenario of oppression and stigma. It must, therefore, commit to fostering solutions beyond academic walls, enabling exchanges with subjects and groups often marginalized from these discussions but affected by them and creating resistances in their daily lives.\nIn this sense, we emphasize that promoting an event like this, aimed at creating displacements in the very form of producing knowledge and academic practices, was only possible from a perspective of collective work and with the different social actors forming this context. Mutual contagion of experiences, thoughts, and creations. A technical production, but also alive, launching us into new problems and concerns for our studies, research, and practices. At the interface between the University and society, we affirm an affective engagement centered on breaking rigid models of knowledge production, forming ourselves also as body-researcher-experimenters of an anti-asylum mental health and new ways of learning, caring, and living.",

    "text": "4.1 LAEDDES & ENEDDES: Extension in Motion (A Brief Historical Overview)\nThe Interdisciplinary Meeting of Studies on Inequalities & Diversities - ENEDDES, previously named ENEDES in its first two editions in 2013 and 2016, emerged from the studies and research conducted by the extensionists of the university extension program “Knowledge is Active Citizenship - LAEDES - Laboratory of Studies on Inequalities” (from March 2010 to August 2018), part of the Psychology course at the Federal University of Ceará, Sobral Campus.\nThe extension program, initiated in 2010, stimulates debate and articulation of studies on poverty, inequality, and exclusion, drawing from Sociology, Critical Social Psychology, Psychology, Education, among others. The project targeted public school students, most of whom experienced the implications of poverty and its complications.\nThe extension group conducted activities to demystify the discourse of meritocracy and the fatalism that the impoverished face daily. Using the methodology of conversation circles, dialogues with students aimed to promote arguments against blaming poor people, presenting education as a path to autonomy, citizenship, and political participation. Embedded in a public university in the interior, part of the federal university expansion program, and attentive to the context of social marginalization, suffering, and expiation of the poor population, LAEDDES has always positioned itself against the false meritocracy discourse. With the advancement of discussions and student movements, in 2018, the program’s title was changed to: LAEDDES – Laboratory of Studies on Inequalities & Diversities.\nThis name change reflects the theoretical, methodological, ethical, and political transformations of the undergraduates in academic and social debates and their interaction with the community. Consequently, in 2020, a connection with the Professional Master’s in Psychology and Public Policies at the UFC Sobral campus was established.\nAiming to amplify discussions on these topics and to disseminate the debates developed in the extension program to the academic community and the general public, the Laboratory took on the challenge and commitment to organize ENEDES, viewing it as an event capable of mobilizing new tensions, creating interaction spaces between undergraduates and scholars, raising theoretical and practical reflections that could reverberate in social transformations and contribute to and innovate in public policy creation.\nThe Interdisciplinary Meeting of Studies on Inequalities – ENEDES, occurred in two editions, in 2013 and 2016, attracting over 500 people, including students and professionals from various fields such as Psychology, Social Sciences, Social Work, as well as professionals working in education and public policies in Sobral and neighboring municipalities. The event successfully promoted debates on Education, Inequalities, and Democracy.\nDuring this period, the event’s name was altered to ENEDDES - National Meeting of Studies on Inequalities and Diversities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the third in-person event was not held. However, considering the immense impacts of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations, the Pré-Eneddes was organized virtually in November 2020 to create dialogues on the pandemic’s context, the deterioration of public policies, and their effects on education, health, social assistance, and democracy, as a way to address pain and anguish and to advocate for collective well-being.",

    "text": "4.2 ENEDDES in Its Different Versions: An Ongoing Journey\n\n4.2.1 1st ENEDES\nThe 1st Interdisciplinary Meeting of Studies on Social Inequality - ENEDES, an event planned and organized by LAEDES (Laboratory of Studies on Inequalities), with the support of the Federal University of Ceará, occurred in person on March 11, 12, and 13, 2013, in the city of Sobral - Ceará.\nThe event included the participation of professionals and students from various fields who discussed the theme and its implications through conferences, round tables, and presentations of works, producing and sharing important knowledge and generating academic and practical mobilizations concerning social inequalities.\nIn the first edition of ENEDES, we had the presence, among other professionals and scholars in the field, of Professor Pedrinho Guareschi, who reminded us of the importance of caring for different types of knowledge, recalling Paulo Freire. Popular knowledge is fundamental for us to deal with the pains and worldviews, while scientific knowledge serves as lenses that alert us to which direction we should look. He argued that education is still the gateway to emancipation and the exit from precarious conditions of economic, political, and cultural misery. In summary, these were the rich discussions and debates that permeated the three-day event.\n\n\n4.2.2 2nd ENEDES\nThe second meeting, titled II ENEDES and I International Symposium on Poverty and Social Transformation, was held in person on December 14 and 15, 2016. Its main objective was to discuss topics transversal to LAEDES themes, such as:\n\nCitizenship;\nDemocracy and Human Rights;\nPoverty and Coping Strategies;\nPoverty, Media, and Social Representations;\nYouth and Vulnerabilities;\nPublic Health;\nGender and Social Determinants;\nMusic and Social Transformation.\n\nAt this event, we had the presence of Ana Fonseca, a researcher and promoter of the Bolsa Família Program in Brazil, who fought against social inequalities through public policies until her death. The event also featured Canadian researchers Susan O’Neill and Yaroslav Senyshyn, who presented music as a means of emancipation from poverty. The II ENEDES concluded with a conference on Social Representations of Poverty by Aline Accorssi, enriched by different representatives speaking from various fields of knowledge.\n\n\n4.2.3 Pré-ENEDDES\nIn times of backlash against social policies and dismantling of fundamental achievements for improving the living conditions of low-income populations affected by ethical-political suffering, organizing the Pré-ENEDDES edition was considered a form of resistance. It also provided access to knowledge from various fields for our target audience, including UFC students and public school teachers. We hope that the debates promoted by the event, related to reflections on the intersections between poverty and education, as well as discussions on gender, race, and class relations within public schools, contribute to the training of LAEDDES extension students, public school teachers, and other members of the academic community. The Pré-ENEDDES was organized by undergraduate students and master’s students in Psychology and Public Policies.",

    "text": "4.3 Debate and Mobilization Axes: Social Inequalities, Youth, and Education\n\n4.3.1 Social Inequalities – Poverty: Outlines and Definitions\nStudying and thinking about poverty is a delicate subject with a difficult definition. Within our theoretical field of human sciences, our question is more qualitative and variable, under construction. As Accorssi and Scarparo (2016) have warned, “poverty is a polysemic and complex concept that requires care” (p. 68). The definitions of public policies to combat poverty and the economic perspectives of the World Bank and MDS, GDP, HDI, have their importance in directing policies aimed at people in vulnerable social contexts and in strategies to combat this situation. However, these are not the only ways to understand the concept of poverty.\nPoverty is not just food insecurity, precarious housing, or lack of education; it is also political. As Pedro Demo (2006) explains, poverty “is not pure and simple misery, but the one imposed, the discriminatory one, or, above all, the one of the majority due to the enrichment of the minority” (p. 7).\nPoverty can also be thought of as unequal access to modes of production. For Estanislau and Ximenes (2016), poverty is a “process, a consequence of the capitalist mode of production, whose important characteristics are the exploitation of labor to produce wealth and the concentration of income. A significant contingent of individuals is precariously inserted into the production process” (p. 142).\nContinuing on unequal access, Jessé Souza (2003) identifies poverty as the constitution and reproduction in differentiated modes of people’s skills who, without access or with greater limitations to educational and professional qualification, cannot enter or remain in the qualified labor market for a prolonged period.\nThe term impoverished is the classification chosen by Guareschi (1992) to talk about poverty. For him, in a world of categories, it is possible to talk about poor and rich, but in the world of relationships, no, as it requires one and the other. In this case, there are enriched and impoverished individuals, a dialectical relationship, people who have been impoverished.\nThere is a multiplicity of classifications, ways to measure and identify poverty. This indicates that the issue of income does not sufficiently explain how this phenomenon is experienced and defined by people. Various authors describe poverty in a broad way, alerting to the need for a plural vision of the phenomenon and dimensions of participation, dignity, and social recognition. Poverty is not a natural condition and, although historical, dialectical, it therefore requires combat (Guzzo, 2016).\n\n\n4.3.2 Brazil, a Country of Poverty: Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Implications\nIn Brazil, even with the old commitments to eradicate poverty in international agreements and the exit from the hunger map in 2012, the country has regressed and suffers from the estimated numbers of 61 million people in poverty, 19.3 million of whom are in extreme poverty, according to the research by the Center for Research in Macroeconomics of Inequalities at the University of São Paulo (Nassif-Pires et al., 2021). Thus, poverty remains latent, absurd, and immoral at all levels.\nThis scenario is most often explained from an economicist perspective, of a neoliberal nature, but it needs to be expanded. After all, it is not just about material absences; poverty “can entail specific and oppressive forms of identity constitution, weakening individuals’ potentialities, maintaining existing conditions of oppression in society, and reproducing discriminatory practices towards poor individuals” (Moura Junior, 2012, p. 15).\nThat said, it is important to remember the ruptures of bonds, the precariousness that poverty represents most of the time. In Brazil, in this social, cultural, and political segregation, poverty and exclusion align. Thus, the naturalization of poverty and the stigmas of this category gain painful dimensions (Wanderley, 1999).\nIn this class of disposables, there is no process of citizenship, but rather one of subcitizenship, a collective practice of unjust social recognition. In it, the notion of subcitizenship implies a hierarchical valuation of people, implicitly and institutionally rooted in an invisible way, which determines who is or is not considered human and, consequently, who is or is not a citizen. This process fundamentally impacts the differentiated access to material and symbolic resources in social life (Souza, 2003).\nVarious constraints cross this group not only by material lacks, an unquestionable fact, but also by subjective ones, that is, in the social imagination of these people. As part of this, processes such as shame and humiliation were well depicted in the studies of Moura Jr. (2012), Ximenes et al. (2016), and Jovchelevitch (2013). The field of imagination, of planning, is strongly affected when experiencing a family/educational context marked by poverty, which “can permeate different levels and spaces: from hunger to existential (subjective) conditions, and from these conditions to ruptures in sociability relations” (Accorssi & Scarparo, 2016, p. 91).\nIn this sense, studying poverty and its implications on the subjectivities of the poor population crosses the creation and constitution of events and debates. Inviting, dialoguing, and listening to scholars on the subject was a way to stimulate in other spaces and audiences the need for greater closeness to the theme, favor the continuity of studies/research, present gaps, and reflect on other (re)actions and places of action.\n\n\n4.3.3 Social Inequalities: The Interfaces of Subcitizenship in Peripheral Societies\nThe work of sociologist Jessé de Souza brought a vast collection of theories related to Brazil’s exclusive modernization process and the production of subcitizens. His concept of subcitizen reveals the naturalization of oppression and humiliation experienced by most of the population and is recognized by an illusory concept of equality in the current competitive order.\nThe individual who is already born deprived of basic conditions such as health, food, education, or has limited access to them, has a high chance of not meeting the competitive market’s demands, which probably will not give them social recognition and “utility” in this economic model (which incorporates the social), potentially leaving them at the mercy of dramatic political and personal consequences.\nSubcitizenship is not only related to the historical marginalization of various social groups but also to the reproduction and maintenance of most individuals outside the objective order of modern production, which requires specific personalities and behaviors. Becoming a complete and productive citizen is intimately related to the concept of the rational subject’s dignity. As this mode of production acquired almost dogmatic characteristics over the years, failure is seen as a personal misfortune, causing millions to remain on the margins of society (Souza, 2003).\nUnderstanding subcitizenship and how it is structured also involves reinterpreting Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus by sociologist Jessé Souza, who states:\n\nIf habitus represents the incorporation in subjects of evaluative schemes and behavioral dispositions from a structural socioeconomic situation, then fundamental changes in the economic-social structure must consequently imply significant qualitative changes in the type of habitus for all social classes involved in some way in these changes (Souza, 2003, p. 165)\n\nSouza (2003) analyzed the concept of habitus in three spheres to explain other configurations of reality. The primary habitus, he defines, originates from Bourdieu’s studies on the transition of traditional societies to modern society in the West. This habitus would have originated in the bourgeoisie, the first ruling class in capitalist society.\nFor Bourdieu, the “secondary habitus” lies in the dimension of “taste.” It would be at the upper limit of the “precarious habitus,” where the “primary habitus” extends to a wide range of people in a given society. It is related to the source of social recognition and respect, in which patterns of social classification and distinction play a prominent role (Souza, 2003).\nThe focus of this theory’s deepening lies in the concept coined by Souza (2003) of “precarious habitus.” The concept of habitus in marginal societies, late capitalism, can be extended to its most precarious level, where it would be a place marked by the lack of a set of psychosocial tendencies reflected in the role of the producer, in the field of personality, with direct reflections on the role of the citizen.\nIndividuals of this habitus have not incorporated these requirements into their daily lives to constitute themselves as “full and complete citizens.” They lack a sufficient position in the labor market, especially if we attribute to work the basic values that constitute this “meritocratic triad.” From their qualification, position, and salary, this individual and their group will be recognized in their society (Souza, 2003).\nIt is possible, therefore, to perceive that there is a power relationship, those who can and those who cannot, the visible and the invisible, the legitimate and the illegitimate, and, therefore, there is, on the part of the social, a domination of positions and spaces established for this other, besides being seen as the culprit for social failures. This relationship became possible when modernity architected a binary logic, which denominated in different ways the negative component of the cultural relationship: marginal, indigent, mad, disabled, drug addict, homosexual, foreigner, etc (Duschatzky & Skliar, 2001).",

    "section": "4.4 Debate Axis: Youth and Education: The Relationship of Poor Youth with School",
    "text": "4.4 Debate Axis: Youth and Education: The Relationship of Poor Youth with School\nWhen discussing poverty, social inequality, and gender themes, ENEDDES directs these discussions to the young public, understanding that they are directly affected by these phenomena and all their implications. Therefore, it is important to understand what youth the event addressed and the relationship of poor youth with education.\nAccording to Léon (2005), in the country, various fields of study and authors have dedicated themselves to discussing youth, thus constructing various views on this category, structured from different social and political perspectives, which end up fostering and guiding actions aimed at this public. These perspectives often generate dichotomous views on youth.\nThe multiple images about youth are socially constructed models, which often bring simplistic views that prevent us from “understanding the ways in which young people, especially those from popular classes, construct their experiences” (Dayrell, 2003, p. 41), making these experiences often neglected.\nYouth cannot be taken as a unique, singular, chronological, and homogeneous phenomenon, analyzed, and understood from a rigid axis. As Cordeiro (2009) affirms, being young goes beyond a generational phase, as it is related to multiple life experiences, linked to young people’s belonging to the different social spaces they occupy, whether it is school, work, or the community. It is about transiting through these experiences, being crossed and constituted by them.\nIn this sense, ENEDDES worked with the notion of plural, heterogeneous youth and considered the multiple ways and experiences of being young, understanding young people as social subjects who appropriate and interpret the contexts they are inserted in, giving them meaning, just as they give meaning to the places they occupy. Thus, young people are subjects who are biologically, socially, and culturally constituted in relationships with others (Dayrell, 2003).\nTaking these young people as social subjects means considering that each one lives the condition of being young based on contexts and previous histories. Therefore, markers such as gender, race, economic conditions, social class, and inequality directly interfere with the ways of being young, as well as in their trajectories and how they signify and understand education.\nThe relationship young people establish with school is constructed from numerous markers and can acquire different meanings. Sposito and Galvão (2004) point out that the meanings young people attribute to education arise from the subjectivation and experiences of each individual. Given this, it is necessary to consider that education in the lives of poor youth assumes different roles; for many, it is seen as a stage or a duty to be fulfilled, for others, a tool for transforming the realities they live.\nEducation in Brazil is pointed out in both studies and public policy actions as one of the main tools to combat inequalities, essential for overcoming social problems and for social mobility. However, this relationship between inequality and education yields permanent dialogues, as sometimes education is believed to overcome social inequalities, and at other times, it is seen as an eternal source of reproducing inequalities (Yannoulas, 2013).\nBourdieu and Passeron (2014) describe the school as a space for reproducing social inequalities, which are felt in the unequal distribution of educational opportunities according to origin and social class, in the access of poor youth to education systems, and in how this access occurs.\nSouza (2009) highlighted that, in a space marked by social inequality, the dissemination of advanced knowledge is still limited to children and youth from the dominant classes. Meanwhile, children from poor families receive limited education in the school to the basic knowledge type required for their future professional lives. He also highlights the myth of individual merit (meritocracy), which would depend on isolating the individual from society, as if everything they achieve in their life did not depend on the possibilities that society offers them.\nAnalyzing the relationship between poverty and the student population, Duarte (Duarte, 2012) points out that 44% of the student population in public elementary education in Brazil was in poverty in 2009. In the Northeast region, 67% of students were in social vulnerability conditions.\nStill according to the same author, analyzing the indices between youth and schooling, the disparities are significant. While 76% of students among the wealthiest 25% had completed high school by the age of 19, among the poorest 25%, this rate drops to 16%. For youth between 15 and 17 years old attending high school, the rate is 81% among the wealthiest and 30% among the poorest. These indices indicate that poor students are not a minority in public schools; they are a majority that needs to be considered (Duarte, 2012).\nConsidering the interfaces of subcitizenship in education, the issue is often marked by many educators’ view of the impoverished student, as Souza (2009) points out:\n\n… Analyzing public education policy texts from the State of São Paulo, he found the presence of demeaning conceptions about popular classes, accompanied by the idea that the school needs to assume the family’s role. This perspective ends up transforming the school institution mainly into a space for socialization, having its capacity to fulfill its social function impaired (p. 51).\n\nConsidering public education policy, we recognize this field as a strong marker of individual differences, as it has long been constituted on the sphere of difference and categorization of individuals, including the various manifestations of poverty and social inequality. Thus, the school must continuously evaluate its practices, think and experiment with new educational practices to better establish relationships with the social reality in which it is inserted. It is noted that it is not about destroying or extinguishing established parameters but generating a denaturalization of traditional teaching measures to constitute educational practices that genuinely promote education and, consequently, citizenship.\nIt is fundamentally important to realize that the school context is strongly linked to the constitution of social and subjective representation. The plurality of structuring forms creates a dialectic between standardization or permissiveness. The school will serve as a mediator, or rather, an environment that will propose mediations between individuals who will be constituted from the interaction with others and the positions they will occupy in the social context in which they are inserted.\nConsidering education as a promoter of citizenship, it should include social diversity and recognize these individuals as subjects of rights, who come from different cultural realities and experiences, building their frame of reference for thought and action from this. It is up to the teacher to broaden their view beyond the school’s walls, to know the student’s starting territory, their values, what is significant in their life.\nIn this sense, school education is one of the main and fundamental spaces for systematically disseminating principles related to differences, diversities, and inequalities, requiring the performance of committed and well-informed teachers. However, the teachers’ own training in related topics is still very limited, hindering quality work with students at various educational levels, as good intentions alone are not enough for the educator to deal with the issues of difference, diversity, and inequality. It takes much more than that; it requires theoretical grounding and knowledge on the topics.\nBesides serving as a mechanism, the place for difference should not be forced but managed. The school should not position itself as an institution of fixed concepts and ways of dealing with individuals but should perceive itself as an institution dealing with subjects who present themselves in various possible performances.\nThus, education can be a valuable tool for helping liberate historically impoverished groups, consolidating the generation of rights; or it can configure the opposite, becoming another instrument of humiliation, social rejection, and disdain by public agents towards the poor, reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices (Brandão et al., 2013).",

    "text": "4.5 Transgressional Axes: Diversities\nIn addition to the initial thematic axes, the event’s discussions included themes such as gender, the LGBTQIA+ movement, race/ethnicity, peripheral youth, and marginal lives and knowledge. Space for other epistemologies is necessary to ensure the foundation of studies and actions. Thus, decolonial studies, black feminism, feminist and gender studies also incorporate the foundations of research and analyses of the extension program’s works and future events.\n\n4.5.1 Intersectionality\nArising from the extension’s concerns and experiences, ENEDDES focused on organizing an event to debate themes and works from the concept of intersectionality. According to Akotirene (2019), intersectionality is a multiple concept, being a theory, methodology, and research tool that, by articulating race, gender, and class, critically analyzes the intersection and convergence of cisheteronormative/patriarchal/imperialist/racist structures, among others, as well as an ethic aimed at recovering silenced voices, annulled bodies, new humanities. In this sense, in Crenshaw’s (2002) analogy, thinking from intersectionality means perceiving the clash between historically oppressive structures as traffic lanes that dictate advantages and disadvantages depending on one’s “place” in the world. Thinking and articulating social issues intersectionally allows for analyzing the dynamics of the social structure and its pernicious products. It is not about overlapping oppressions, quantifying pain, but thinking and developing politically other modes of (re)knowledge.\n\n\n4.5.2 Gender: Multiple Understandings, Still Unknown to Popular Knowledge\nGender is a term and concept of broad debate not for the purpose of producing an exact, static definition, but to promote dialogue and distance from misunderstandings about the topic. The understanding that gender and sexuality are relational and natural is still prevalent and dangerous.\nThus, regarding gender, a concept produced from feminist movements and struggles, there is no consensus and exact definition. However, according to authors such as Berenice Bento, Guacira Louro, and Judith Butler, gender, although considering physical elements of the body, is not defined by biological sex or sexuality. Gender is a social and historical construction about the biological distinctions of bodies crossed by socially elaborated sexual characteristics. It is in social relations, discourses, and languages that gender, gender performance, emerges and reproduces.\nConstituent of subjectivities, there is no determinism, biological essentialism, but a social, relational question about the category, which is analytical and political. It is also in the social arena of relational, institutional practices that gender inequalities and hierarchies occur.",

Therefore, it is impossible to think of ENEDDES without LAEDDES. For the people who designed the meetings, the classroom extends beyond the disciplines. In each text, discussion, and theme, there were struggles in this process: welcoming, learning, sharing. Guided by an education as a practice of freedom and not as an activity of domination (hooks, 2013), the event’s foundation will always be laid.\nThe daily difficulty of hoping, especially after the most progressive period of the supposed Brazilian democracy, is highlighted. The defamation of human rights, the dismantling of public policies, the freezing of public spending, the commodification of public education, the fascist governmental structure, and the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated social inequalities, poverty, and silenced youth and marginal knowledge.\nDespite the limitations the event faced, we hope that by presenting the memory of ENEDDES, it can, beyond registering our existences, contribute to further studies on the topic, foster other research on the subject, and strengthen practices and public policies aimed at combating inequalities, especially in educational institutions.",

    "title": "5  The Challenges of Public Servant Health: An Advisory Report",
    "section": "",
    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nThere is a difficulty in establishing the relationship between work and the illness of public servants (Ramminger & Nardi, 2007). Until 2009, the health of public servants at Universities and Federal Institutes was related to medical and dental examinations. Health promotion and prevention actions and their aggravations were practically nonexistent before the implementation of the Policy for Attention to Health and Occupational Safety of Federal Public Servants (PASS). The demands of this public, until then, were focused on improvements in remuneration and training. After the structuring and consolidation of the career plan for technical-administrative positions in education, from Law No. 11,091, of January 12, 2005 (2005), health issues began to gain greater visibility. Thus, there is a need to think about and problematize the forms of work organization and socio-professional relationships in public service (Ramminger & Nardi, 2007).\nThe case presented here reports an intervention in health promotion at work carried out in the accounting and finance sector of a federal university. Therefore, this is an advisory report provided to this sector, which was responsible for coordinating and overseeing the institution’s budget, as well as managing contracts and agreements. Among other duties, the workers in this sector checked all payments made by the institution daily to avoid improper or incorrect entries; issued commitment notes, which guaranteed the reservation of resources for payment to companies or individuals who had contracts with the University; and dealt with the payment of scholarships and allowances.\nThe initial demand for the intervention came from the collective of workers referred to the University’s Pro-Rectory of Personnel Management, after seven servants requested removal from the sector due to conflicts with managers. The complaint concerned the difficult relationship with the leadership and the imposition of new rules. The servants also highlighted the lack of autonomy, as decisions were made unilaterally by the leadership, authoritatively, without dialogue with the group. There were also changes in work processes without prior communication with the team. These issues reflected in low motivation for work and the interest of several servants in changing sectors. However, the removal of all servants from one sector to another, even within the same public administration body, was not a plausible solution.\nIn light of this, what would justify a health promotion intervention based on the problems presented, as they were not directly related to physical or mental illnesses? This is due to an understanding that health is not the opposite of illness: it is possible to lose health even before falling ill. Having health, in this way, is being able to act and, especially, being able to reinvent oneself in the face of difficulties encountered in the activity carried out at work. Therefore, health is impaired when the worker’s power to act is limited (Clot, 2010).\nIt is thus seen that the ability of the servants in the accounting and finance sector to reorganize their activities in the face of imposed limits was curtailed to the point that they assessed that the only possible path was to leave the sector. In this sense, a health promotion intervention was necessary to allow these workers to regain their power to act. In light of this, a work psychologist and a group of psychology student interns linked to the institution’s Pro-Rectory of Personnel Management took on the demand and promoted an intervention that, as will be seen below, repositioned the workers in the face of their own activity and the demands presented, as well as opened a communication channel with the managers.\nThe intervention carried out was based on the Activity Clinic, which proposes to be a theory of action and transformation in work contexts. This perspective emphasizes the importance of strengthening and developing the work collective. To understand the Activity Clinic, it is important to elucidate the concept of craft, defined as the structure resulting from the conflict between four dimensions, which are: impersonal, transpersonal, personal, and interpersonal (Clot, 2010).\nThe impersonal dimension comprises the rules and conditions to which workers are subject, such as arrival and departure times, materials and work tools, safety standards, and procedure manuals. The transpersonal dimension (or professional genre) also concerns norms. In this case, however, they are those formulated by the work collective itself, constitutive of an implicit professional culture that, even if not formally recorded, guides workers’ actions in moments of difficulty. Each professional, in turn, imprints their history on the activity they perform and also develops new rules based on their experiences. That is why the craft is also personal. Finally, work is done in interaction with other people (colleagues, managers, consumers, among others), which characterizes the interpersonal level (Clot, 2010).\nIt is also pertinent to understand the distinction between performed activity and real activity (Clot, 2006). The first consists of the actions that the worker effectively performs at their workstation and that, in many cases, are visible to an external observer. The real activity, in turn, is the set of possibilities that, at some point, were on the worker’s horizon of action but were not realized. It is from the real activity that it becomes possible to renew the possibilities of acting in work contexts.\nUnderstanding these definitions, the work psychologist who works from the Activity Clinic can help workers revitalize professional cultures and also seek new forms of action from the real activity. In this way, it is possible to develop the power to act on the work environment, the organization, and oneself, which therefore implies promoting health.\nFrom this perspective, it is not up to the psychologist to make a diagnosis and inventory the psychosocial risks to which workers are exposed. It will be up to her to mediate reflections on the activity so that professionals can find psychosocial and personal resources to perform quality work. It is, thus, her role to assist in the search for unpredictable action capacities in the midst of activity and help rediscover the pleasures of well-done work, considered the driving force of health (Clot, 2017). To this end, the Activity Clinic mobilizes and promotes dialogue, aiming to resume collective creation and, thus, take care of work. Debates are promoted between workers, who hold the knowledge about their own activity, and later, between them and their managers (Clot, 2017).",

    "section": "5.2 Method",
    "text": "5.2 Method\n\n5.2.1 Participants\nThe intervention involved four accountants, one female accountant, one male accounting technician, and one female accounting technician, as well as the immediate and superior managers, both accountants, totaling nine participants. All the servants held the position of Technical-Administrative in Education (TAE) at the Higher Education Institution (IES) and, as mentioned earlier, worked in the accounting and finance sector.\n\n\n5.2.2 Procedures, Instruments, and Course of the Intervention\nBefore starting the presentation about the instruments and procedures used in the intervention, it is important to recall the idea that in the Activity Clinic, no preliminary diagnosis is made that would provide the psychologist with prescriptions that workers must follow to solve problems related to the activity or to gain more health and satisfaction. It is also not her goal to produce a list of risks, whether physical, ergonomic, or psychosocial, to produce an external evaluation of the work.\nThe aim is, from the workers’ protagonism, to put action in motion, to dialogue about it, and, with that, to break the barriers of crystallized activities, those that are already established and can no longer handle the challenges faced by workers. Thus, the goal is to rediscover new ways of acting in the activity and in the midst of discussions with the work collective (therefore in the interpersonal dimension of the craft), facilitating workers’ reflection to expand their power to act (Clot, 2006). That said, it is also worth clarifying that all the stages described below are part of the intervention and that the procedures and instruments presented are used as mediators to achieve the objective indicated above.\nInitially, two meetings were held with the managers of the accounting and finance sector to explain the work proposal. On these occasions, the objectives of the action and the methodology that would be employed were presented. A similar procedure was followed with the servants, and subsequently, a working group was created with those who agreed to participate. The intervention was divided into three stages:\n\nDocument analysis;\nObservation of activities and\nConducting instructions to the double (ID).\n\nIn the first stage, documents that characterized, regulated, and standardized the workers’ activities were sought. The duties of the sector, its objectives, and its organizational structure were also analyzed. Additionally, the technical processes developed and the tasks explicitly assigned to the servants, as well as positions and functions of the sector, were examined. The aim was to understand the prescriptions of activities, norms, and procedures, as well as the general characteristics of work organization, that is, the impersonal dimension of the craft. The intention was thus to build the basis for dialogue between the working group and the intervention team, as well as among the workers themselves, through which the conflict over the quality of work could be thought about and debated (Clot, 2013). However, as will be seen later, some of these norms were not clearly defined for either managers or workers.\nIn the second phase, observations were made to access the performed activities. This procedure yields a double result. The first is linked to producing knowledge about the observed object, the activity, following a tradition well developed by ergonomics and other approaches that value the study of situated work. The second, in turn, is related to the fact that the observation already generates an intervention in the field by producing an internal dialogue in the worker (Clot, 2010). From this perspective, it was possible to understand and analyze work processes and identify problems and potentialities related to professionals’ engagement with the changes to be made in procedures.\nThe days and times of observations were previously agreed upon with the servants, and at the end of each visit, the team produced a report based on what was seen and what was said by the sector employees. Seven observation moments, each lasting an average of 3 hours, were conducted. Once this process was completed, a meeting was held with all the servants to discuss the systematizations produced. It was then possible to discuss suggestions and improvements proposed by the workers, which were negotiated and debated with the sector management. Thus, a partnership was established between managers and servants to implement the necessary measures.\nUpon completion of this stage, the third phase began, in which two meetings were held to conduct the ID, which consists of a technique where the activity clinician gives the following directive to the worker: “suppose I am your double and that tomorrow I will replace you in your workplace. What instructions should you give me so that no one notices the substitution?” (Clot, 2006, p. 144). For this stage, the group was divided into two according to the nature of the activities performed.\nIn each subgroup, one servant was asked to volunteer to be the double’s instructor, who was a member of the intervention team. After the instruction was completed, a space was opened for the other group members, who were in the observer position, to participate. They could then explain disagreements, questions, and additions regarding the worker’s speech in the instructor position. Once the instructions to the double were completed, the recorded speeches were transcribed and returned to the servants so they could read and extract points for discussion.\nNext, meetings were held with each subgroup to discuss the points highlighted by them from reading the transcribed material. Among the themes addressed by the servants in these meetings, discussions included the nature of activities; rework and overload; the need for training; meeting goals; relationships with management; control of the information registration system, among others. Finally, meetings were held to discuss these issues with all the working group members.\nThe intervention concluded with a general meeting where workers and managers discussed the demands raised at each stage and the changes made that were favorable to the group in the development of their activities. There was also a debate on suggested improvements that were not achieved for various reasons, including legal limits imposed on the public sector.",

    "section": "5.3 Results and Discussions",
    "text": "5.3 Results and Discussions\nNext, the obstacles discussed by the servants for performing quality work and the potentialities envisioned for reconstructing their activity and craft will be presented, based on the procedures and techniques previously presented and the discussions held with the work collective. The development of the power to act and the strengthening of workers around issues related to the impersonal dimension, specifically regarding work conditions and organization, and interpersonal relationships, were observed.\nRegarding working conditions, the servants stated that there was little space for circulation in the room where they worked, as it was small for the amount of furniture it had. Concerning the available tools for performing activities, they pointed out that most did not have a mousepad with arm support, which is important when spending long periods using computers and performing continuous movements. It was also suggested that this could lead them to develop repetitive strain injuries.\nAdditionally, there was a lack of essential materials for performing activities, such as highlighters, to mark important values in notes to be entered into the system, and rulers and pens in good condition, as those provided by the university were of inferior quality and soon became unusable. Given this, workers ended up buying these and other materials themselves. In light of these issues and the impediments they posed to their activities, the collective could debate proposals discussed with the managers during the intervention, such as reorganizing the desks and chairs to improve circulation in the room and requesting consumable materials directly from the pro-rector to the warehouse sector, so that requests were met in a timely manner, as the response time to individual requests was very long.\nRegarding aspects related to work organization, the lack of clear and defined prescription was one of the main complaints raised by the servants, as the sector did not have an established workflow chart guiding how activities should be performed. The prescription consists of the task, norms, values, obligations, and procedures previously anticipated by the organization. Thus, it is understood that the lack of clarity on this generates doubts and uncertainties for performing activities. In this sense, while excessive prescription prevents creations and stylizations, its absence leaves the worker without a guide by which they can orient their actions, which can paralyze them (Pinheiro et al., 2016).\nGiven this lack, the intervention facilitators tried to refer the group to the informal prescriptions established by the work collective, the transpersonal dimension of the craft. They tried to make explicit, therefore, tacit guidelines that guided actions so that mutual support was provided for doubts and unforeseen events arising from what the formal prescription showed insufficient. Thus, it was possible to strengthen the work group by making explicit a professional genre (Clot, 2010) that guided them, allowing the establishment of some guidelines, especially regarding each one’s duties, sector process flows, and procedures to be followed when problems were identified. It is thus perceived that “the power of (re)creation in the work environment develops from the appropriation of resources for action elaborated in the collective” (Souto et al., 2015, p. 13), that is, in the professional genre, resources for performing activities can be mobilized.\nStill regarding work organization, the collective debated the goals set for the sector. It was noticed that these were inappropriately constructed, as they did not consider the activity flow. It was complained that the unachievable goals were defined without group participation and imposed hierarchically. The way results were measured did not match reality. The servants then created an activity monitoring spreadsheet to establish future goals with the management, considering the sector’s reality and needs.\nAnother demand brought by the workers concerned the lack of dialogue between them and their managers. In many cases, the servants’ autonomy was constantly curtailed by decisions from superiors. Thus, feeling alienated from their activity, the servants were unmotivated to carry out tasks and performed them dispassionately, fearing that, at any moment, other changes could be imposed without the collective’s consent. Additionally, the managers’ inability to dialogue also led to the workers having only necessary, unfriendly, or even hostile communication among themselves.\nThis generated a stiffening of relationships and an exacerbation of individualities, resulting in frequent removal requests, which caused high turnover in the sector, aggravated by the management’s practice of constantly changing servants’ functions. It was observed that these changes were imposed hierarchically without the participation of those who would stop performing their previous function and start performing a new one, without any prior debate or consultation about their interest in performing this new task. When they felt capable of performing a function, for example, by reading specific legislation, and were trained and accustomed to their activity, they were relocated to a new function without any justification.\nAll this resulted in difficulties for the group to recognize itself as a work collective, as the servants did not see in each other a peer to refer to or turn to in difficult situations. This brings to light the mention that the sense of belonging to a collective allows the preservation of the craft. The set of possible and impossible actions, the tacit agreements made between the group, constitute a generic resource that acts as a guide for individual activity. When the renewal of the genre is hindered, the collective is exposed to the unforeseen realities, and the subjects can no longer recognize themselves in what they do (Clot, 2010).\nDuring the intervention, there was a change in one of the managers. Throughout the discussions in the instruction to the double, the workers stated that the new manager had training in the area of expertise and was always available, sensitive to the group’s demands, which positively impacted this relationship. The new management accepted, for example, the proposal for annual rotation with servants who performed mechanical and repetitive activities, using the same keyboard commands and computer screen to analyze various processes daily. Some processed up to 50 cases daily, which made it “tedious, repetitive, and tiring,” in the words of one of the accounting technicians.\nAnother change implemented by the new management, at the collective’s request, was decentralizing some activities to other sectors, reducing the workload. The practice of assigning accounting workers to functions of other sectors’ servants on vacation was also suspended, as it caused workload and dissatisfaction among the group, as the new function was not within their duties and should be performed by someone from the original sector.",

    "text": "5.4 Conclusions and Limitations of the Intervention\nThe intervention was carried out in a context marked by servants’ demotivation and various problems related to work organization and conditions, as well as the relationship between servants and their managers. Numerous debates on the activity and craft were promoted, allowing workers to find new ways of proceeding and to dialogue with managers about the difficulties encountered, positively contributing to the group’s interpersonal relationships. Thus, there was an expansion of the power to act, which, from the Activity Clinic perspective, means promoting health. As a limitation, the initial difficulty of sensitizing the managers about the importance of considering the proposals brought by the workers as necessary for the proper development of activities was observed.\nAnother limitation concerned some old and therefore outdated federal legislation that did not keep up with the institution’s changes and modernization processes, generating a contradiction between the innovations imposed by management and the rigidity of the regulations, making some processes more cumbersome due to bureaucracy, whereas they could be more agile. However, modifying or updating the legislation is carried out by higher, external instances to the university itself, as it is linked to the mobilization of federal ministerial bodies.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nThis chapter describes and analyzes psychosocial interventions with children and adolescents in an urban periphery of Fortaleza, Ceará. It is written by many hands - students, professors, and social articulators - aligning with the commitment to listen to a plurality of voices that ethically bring us closer to the social complexity of ways of existence in various territories. The practices in focus were carried out between 2019 and 2020 and are related to the project Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção, part of university extension in Social Psychology, linked to the research and study group on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation (VIESES) and the Department of Psychology of the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).\nSince 2019, through the articulation with the NGO Centro de Defesa da Vida Herbert de Souza (CDVHS), the Extension Project Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção has been hosted by the Centro de Cidadania e Valorização Humana (CCVH) in the Nova Canudos occupation, in the Canindezinho neighborhood. Given the demand for actions, projects, and activities with children in this area, we built participatory methodologies as experiences that strengthen them as political subjects in the community. Additionally, the actions also emerge from the possibility of conducting training and research activities with children in a peripheral context. During the first year, a group entitled “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos” was consolidated, composed on average of twenty-two (22) children, mostly black, poor, and public school students aged between 6 and 12 years, as well as researchers, students, articulators, and social movement activists, residents of the occupation.\nIn 2020, the demand, made explicit at the beginning of the partnership, persisted and expanded due to the children’s need to:\nAll these demands were crossed by the collective analysis of what was possible to do virtually, given the worsening social inequalities, directly related to the children’s access to social networks. At the same time, other desires were being mobilized and resisted the erasure generated by the naturalization of the precariousness of life in a peripheral context. This created flows for experiments in the audiovisual production scope of children on YouTube, TikTok, and WhatsApp.\nWe start the text by relating peripheral territorialities and modes of subjectivation, as well as repositioning problems and ways of doing. Next, we address the conditions of insertion in the field from a cartographic and procedural perspective, as well as the joint creation of the existential territory in which inter(in)ventive and participatory actions with children and adolescents from the Nova Canudos occupation are forged. These actions are articulated with the CCVH, which not only hosts but is also invented in the political agency of children and adolescents. Finally, we highlight ways of doing (group device) that draw the field of forces of this existential territory, emphasizing the challenges of conducting demands collectively.",

    "text": "6.2 Peripheral Territorialities and Modes of Subjectivation: Acting Starts by Knowing how to Invent Other Problems\nFrom what place do we speak? With whom do we articulate these interventions highlighted here? What knowledge is constructed with Nova Canudos? These questions guide us in writing this topic, beginning by highlighting the narratives of residents and social articulators about this community, as well as socioeconomic indicators present in documents about the neighborhood that come to life in exchanges with children and adolescents.\nNova Canudos was born in 1993 as a popular occupation influenced by the Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs), a movement of the Catholic church oriented by Liberation Theology that tried to link faith and life in pastoral actions. This is because one of the strong issues in the lives of many families in the 1990s in Fortaleza was precisely access to land in the city to guarantee the right to housing. Thus, with the support of the local church, the land was occupied, and the land plots were informally organized. In these, an area was reserved to build a local facility for religious celebrations and community problem discussions. This area gave rise to the Centro de Cidadania e Valorização Humana (CCVH), which is still maintained today as a reference for collective activities carried out in Nova Canudos. In another area, another community center was built with the support of a project called Mãos Unidas, in which volunteer doctors provided care for the population. This facility was incorporated into the basic health care network and is now home to the Abner Cavalcante Brasil Basic Health Unit, the only public health post in the Special Zone of Social Interest (ZEIS) of Bom Jardim, which serves Nova Canudos and other residents of neighboring communities.\nNova Canudos is located in the Canindezinho neighborhood, which, until 2020, was one of the neighborhoods in the Greater Bom Jardim (GBJ) region. As of municipal law no. 278 of 2019, which establishes a new regionalization in the city of Fortaleza, and decree no. 14.590 of 2020, the Canindezinho neighborhood became part of the Regional Executive Secretariat - SER X, being separated from what officially became considered GBJ - SER V (Fortaleza, 2021). The area has high indicators of urban violence and concentrations of poverty and extreme poverty, with a population of 211 thousand inhabitants, according to the Census - IBGE (2010). Given the state’s neglect, popular political articulation became strong, which explains the engagement of residents, from children to - especially - young people and adults, in resident associations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), collectives, and other instruments that allow their participation in the process of organizing, mobilizing, and overseeing public policies aimed at the periphery. Among these articulations present in GBJ, we highlight the action of the Centro de Defesa da Vida Herbert Souza (CDVHS).\nGiven the ethical-political commitment to confronting the processes of vulnerabilization of children’s lives, combined with the recognition of participation practices and community organization historically carried out in GBJ, Nova Canudos became an empowered peripheral territory, open to jointly problematizing the relationships between children and modes of participation, in a contextualized perspective integrated with the children’s movements in the community, highlighting the fact that they are the target audience of the activities carried out and hosted by the CCVH.\nIn this context, a Decolonial Social Psychology (J. P. P. Barros et al., 2017, 2019; Mayorga, 2014), as a network of knowledge, supports the actions of Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção and is eventful between the university and peripheries. Events hold the potency of institutions that can denaturalize and produce breaches in the rigid perceptions of the social fabric and materialize in a racist, sexist, classist, heteronormative, and adult-centric web. Therefore, in this work, peripheries and universities are not given, ready, and finished places, but mutually constitute themselves through combined strategies and strive to denaturalize historical relations of distance and colonization.\nThis partnership, on which we now focus, can reposition social stigmas around the urban peripheries of Fortaleza, in line with the notion that these territories are plural and centers of life production, constantly disputing with hegemonic narratives of disqualification and criminalization. From this perspective, it has been possible to articulate children from different peripheral realities by integrating them into activities of other partner projects, creating records (photographs and videos) of children’s collective action, and participating in public calls to maintain activities, with greater visibility of their ways of life, outside of stereotyped views that minimize their participation in the city. Thus, clues are produced that help denaturalize conceptions of childhood historically constituted in a colonial past, establishing them as a developmental condition that must go through schooling processes and family protection for the full exercise of citizenship (Castro, 2013; Kuhn Junior & De Mello, 2020; Sarmento, 2013).\nRepositioning oneself ethically, aesthetically, and politically operates the invention of other problems with which to move thought. Being WITH complicates ways of acting, requiring negotiations, dialogues, and exchanges in which power-knowledge relations can have their effects analyzed, in order not to corroborate the historical silencing of subalternized classes, which, intersectionally, produce gender, generation, class, and ethnicity/race oppressions. In these two years of action, we have composed some clues for producing situated and implicated problems with which we have (un)learned: a) the need for articulation with territory agents, strengthening struggles and paths built collectively; b) the need for network monitoring of children and adolescents, paying attention to the constantly renewed trust bonds with them and their guardians; c) openness to experience and methodological creativity to carry out non-directed activities that respond to the collective agency of children and the singularization of their processes and demands.",

    "text": "6.3 Conditions of Field Insertion from a Cartographic Perspective\nMaquinarias arrived in 2019 in the territory of Greater Bom Jardim (GBJ) through partnership bonds between social actors and VIESES. These actors, members of the CDVHS, were responsible for building and partially maintaining the bridge that has extended between Maquinarias and CCVH for 2 years. In this community space in Nova Canudos, there were already occasional activities promoted by and for residents, such as capoeira and theater classes, craft workshops for making bracelets, and, not rarely, religious celebrations that mobilized different generational groups. Despite the lack of state assistance, the space remained active and reverberated the effects of collective actions by residents, integrating into the community network in Nova Canudos as a support point for cultural, training, and assistance activities for the population.\nThis organization signaled the CCVH’s openness to the proposition and collective construction of activities with children and adolescents, making it possible for expectations, methodology, and objectives to emerge as an effect of the meetings. This perspective materialized and resonated with the inter(in)ventive and participatory action proposal that the extension project aspired to outline and put into practice (Costa et al., 2020).\nOn the first visit to the CCVH, with the mediation of CDVHS articulators, Maquinarias found, in addition to a resident and member of the association’s board of directors, ten children who, curious about the movement, approached and opened the way, without ceasing to “evaluate” the visitors. In this movement of getting to know and inventing each other, children, articulators, extensionists, and researchers set out to join, following an unforeseen flow, piece by piece, the gears of a new collective in the territory. The name forged for this group by the children themselves, still in the first meeting, “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos,” became quite indicative of how intervention, participation, and (micro)political agency intertwined to consolidate ways of creating, mapping, and processually accompanying an existential territory (L. P. Barros & Kastrup, 2009). In their propositions, the children tension adult-centric models of action, centered on the FOR, and shift them to a doing WITH, articulating and creating spaces to fulfill their demands, besides inhabiting the community center while (re)inventing it.\nThe very insertion of Maquinarias in this existential territory showed itself as a continuous movement, of renewed attempts and conquests of the group’s trust and acceptance, which did not remain static either due to the arrival of new children, their growth, or posture changes. Similarly, the extension project renewed itself through new cycles and commitments between fields of action and the university. These changes impacted the composition of forces and affective ties that mutually constitute Maquinarias and the Nova Canudos collective, understood as group, inter(in)ventive devices, and therefore effects of daily insurgencies, woven in encounters with children and adolescents. Thus, taking cartography as a research and intervention method, university extension activities are combined with the analytical process of a complex reality that occurs in the field, from the implication of extensionists and social articulators in collectively invented actions that produce problems, making the production of knowledge and practice inseparable (Costa et al., 2020; Passos & Barros, 2009).\nThe fact that we consider the processuality that accompanies these bonds - university and periphery, Invenções and Maquinarias, children and extensionists, and many others - brings visibility to important factors, such as:\n\nthe geographical distances that mainly adults traveled to reach the meetings and how these distances - the places to which each belongs - influence how each one connects, highlighting different conditions of vulnerabilities and social privileges;\nthe context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has persisted since the beginning of the second year of the collective’s existence, with all its obstacles, such as the impossibility of face-to-face meetings, unequal access to the internet, and the worsening social vulnerability conditions that permeate the group; and\nthe context of urban violence that surrounds the Nova Canudos occupation. This moving map requires, therefore, the insertion in the field as an attitude and not just a fixed pact, with positions delimited and defined prior to the very process of linking.\n\nThe inhabited territory, therefore, was never given, nor was a flag planted in the corner of the CCVH yard, or any other place that Invenções occupied, claiming Maquinarias’ permanence in that location. It is, however, the confluence of desires and demands that circulate the collective that ties its members and establishes a continuous flow of activities, whether virtual or face-to-face.",

    "section": "6.4 “Inventions of the children of Nova Canudos”: actions of an intergenerational collective",
    "text": "6.4 “Inventions of the children of Nova Canudos”: actions of an intergenerational collective\nA fundamental question seems to us to resume at this point in the text: the fact that the psychosocial interventions in focus here were carried out in the alternation between different creative processes, being the result of collective agencies, which we mapped in their subjectivation effects, without neutralities and/or hierarchical relations. They have marks that we consider potent for actions that place themselves micropolitically in the face of collective and community processes, which directly touch the challenges of political participation in intergenerational groups. Let’s see:\n\nOpenness to improvisation;\nAvailability for creation and experimentation without closed scripts;\nInterest in using and researching materials that favor diverse ways of participation, not necessarily linked to oral discourse;\nInterest in working with groups and willingness to do things together, in order to distance oneself from a specialist (expert) posture.\n\nThus, the “WITH children and adolescents” becomes a trigger for the joint planning of content, materials, places, process records, forms of dissemination, and effects for the group and the community.\nWe understand openness not only to differentiation but also to the group’s becomings and, consequently, to the processuality and heterogeneity of field actions as a way of intervening in the complexity of group agencies (R. B. Barros, 2007). Extensionists and researchers move themselves and the field, faced with the proposal to produce WITH the children and learn from the encounters, also facing the challenge of conducting demands collectively. We bet that this (ethical) posture is close to that defined by the cartography of subjectivation processes, that is: an existential territory is produced by engaging in daily and collectively invented experiences (Alvarez & Passos, 2009).\nThe group’s composition is diverse in terms of age, class, race, and gender markers, with children being able to move between meetings, with the number of participants varying from 15 to 20. This way of being together tensions conceptions of collectives and subjects that are homogeneous and fixed by an identity ideal, understanding a multiplicity of ways of collectively composing that can happen in each field of forces (R. B. Barros, 2007).\n\n6.4.1 Actions in 2019: Invention of a Group Device\nThe actions in the first year, totaling 16 meetings, established being and doing together as a device, with Invenções being a strategy to be seen not only in the community by other generational groups (family members, church group members, and social movement articulators) and by their peers but also in other territories. Additionally, acting collectively and being heard mobilized the children’s desire for two types, both playful and free, of activity: situated, carried out biweekly at the CCVH headquarters, and displaced, carried out in city tours. We will see that in 2020, due to other space-time relations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions were described in a way that these conditions were made visible.\nThe meetings held at the CCVH included drawing workshops; making toys from recyclable materials; movie screenings; collective mapping of places where children circulate in the city; and semester start and end celebrations.\nThe children’s periodic presence at the CCVH mobilized the association’s board to ensure a space for the Invenções group to store productions, materials used, toys, among other needs. This achievement resulted from negotiating the common use of the space with other groups, fostering the participation and visibility of children in the community. Moreover, actions WITH the children became continuous in the territory, not just occasional.\nCity tours and visits to other places in Fortaleza allowed the children to encounter the public dimension of the city that is often denied to them by the walls of social exclusion and urban socio-spatial inequalities. Moving through Fortaleza, beyond Nova Canudos, aligned with the children’s desire and happened through the invitation that Invenções received to participate in two events: the “II Colorindo O Gênero,” a program that is part of the “Curta o Gênero,” annually promoted by the NGO Fábrica de Imagens: ações educativas em cidadania e gênero, and the 2019 edition held at the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura; and the “International Children’s Theater Festival of Ceará” (TIC), with theatrical performances at the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ), both facilities of the Ceará State Culture Secretariat (SECULT-CE). The lack of information on how to access public facilities (theater, cinema, parks, museums), in addition to the personal circumstances that hinder each one, often distances them from the possibility of using them. Thus, the movements experienced by the children problematize feelings of belonging to the city and the possibilities it offers.\nBeing able to move around the city with the children, besides being their desire, proved to be an activity of enormous impact and an important analyzer of the existing boundaries in the city, which invisibilize people living in peripheral territories. These are daily naturalized boundaries that need to be transformed. In this sense, the described tours were powerful opportunities to symbolically and concretely move our way of being in the territories, understood as a vector producing subjectivities.\n\n\n6.4.2 Actions in 2020: Recomposition of Movements Amid the Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic crossed the compositions of university extension and the Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos group, impacting temporalities and ways of accompanying and narrating collective actions. In this context, participation in the public call launched by the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ) with resources from the Poverty Combating Fund (FECOP) enabled the group to remain active and resistant in its collective actions during 2020.\nInvenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos took on the dimension of a project and was awarded in the said Edital, in which children, social articulators, and Maquinarias members were proponents, resulting in cost support for maintaining the activities carried out and strengthening our ties with other neighborhood facilities. The proposition of activities occurred in line with collective demands, implying interventions at the CCVH headquarters, such as purchasing equipment, painting, repairs, and mobilization for cleaning and maintaining the headquarters.\nDuring this period, due to the impossibility of holding face-to-face meetings, movements in social networks were fertilized, interconnecting everyday experiences through exchanges and shares. Despite the pandemic, strengthening bonds, making, and inventing WITH the children continued as our ethical horizon. Therefore, the meetings began to take place through the Google Meet platform, with the WhatsApp group being the space for daily conversations, action agreements, emergence, and sharing of ideas, listening to demands and interests, becoming, thus, a new territory to explore and build. Considering the undemocratic access to the internet and specific demands, we managed to hold some face-to-face meetings, respecting care protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The monitoring of these activities and the mobilization for them to occur took place continuously, almost daily.\nWe call virtual actions those that focused on themes of interest to children and adolescents, as well as those related to the capillarization of their participation in virtual events:\n\n“I Virtual Drawing Exhibition of Maquinarias”;\n“Meeting to talk about YouTube usage”;\n“Collective book readings”;\n“Participation in III Colorindo O Gênero”; and\n“Participation in the 30th Anniversary Live of the Child and Adolescent Statute”.\n\nThe virtual drawing exhibition mobilized us amid the daily life of social isolation, keeping us connected through free expression and each one’s situation at the moment. The drawings were exhibited on the projects’ and CCVH’s social networks. The workshop on the relationships between children and YouTube usage, held in partnership with the Laboratory for Research on Relations Between Childhood, Youth, and Media (LABGRIM), linked to the Institute of Culture and Art/ICA of UFC, emerged from the children’s experiments to create YouTube channels and the desire to talk about their inspirations and goals. From this, it was possible to create a moment to reflect on content production for/on the platform, image exposure, inspirations, and most accessed channels, self-care, and safety.\nMoments to experience reading collectively proved to be powerful, from the expectation of the meeting, through the playful and participatory dimension assumed by the group members. Exchanging perceptions and meanings about the work was a reason for joy, despite the difficulties imposed by low-quality connections and access modes, usually made via cell phones. During mobilizations around the 30th anniversary of the Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA), one of the Invenções girls participated in a live event promoted by the Ceará Children’s Rights Defense Forum (Fórum DCA Ceará), expressing her views on racism and the challenges of the pandemic, as well as reciting two self-authored poems.\nA second set of activities resulted from articulations in the territory, with members of the extension and research team, CDVHS articulators, and the Local, Integrated, and Sustainable Development Network (Rede Dlis), and with the children themselves, namely:\n\n“Distribution of masks and WHO guideline booklet”;\n“Distribution of ‘Invenções e Distração’ kits”;\n“Two cinema sessions at CCVH”;\n“Mutirão de limpeza no CCVH”; and\n“Audiovisual course”.\n\nAll activities required face-to-face meetings, possible at specific times during the COVID-19 pandemic - the presence of these moments was also due to the need to listen to the children’s coping modes and their mental health. The theme of self-care and care for others, as a collective issue, permeated the activities of sharing information about the new coronavirus’s spread and the territory and country’s situation. Thus, the group established itself as a health promotion device, directly related to the children’s experiences, doubts, difficulties, and ideas raised as a collective.",

    "text": "6.5 Final Considerations\nThe psychosocial interventions described and analyzed in this text emerged from the joint accompaniment and proposition of activities with an intergenerational group, including children of different ages, adults, and young residents of the Fortaleza periphery, as well as social articulators and extensionists. The work requires mediation, implication, and continuous active listening to the children, demanding flexibility and methodological creativity.\nIts elaboration characterizes a sensitive, ethical, and contextualized work, through the construction and maintenance of spaces where the exercise of the right to participation by children is real. The collective production of knowledge repositions the university, leaving the imposing place of the center to occupy the place of sharing, of implicated thinking, as one of the forces that produce a common space. From this perspective, learning with the “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos” decolonizes the research field on children’s social participation and strengthens the effects of their actions on community life and public policies impacting peripheral contexts in Fortaleza.\nWe hope that the shared tracks and trails can inspire other actors and territories, once ethically oriented by the interest in creating conditions for children’s participation from their life contexts and daily lives, as well as an invitation to experience creativity and methodological diversity linked to listening to children and adolescents and the desires they mobilize for changes in the social body.",

    "text": "7.1 Introduction\nThe context of the COVID-19 pandemic brought numerous challenges and uncertainties that affected the physical and mental health of the general population. Work environments were impacted, and workers underwent adaptation processes in their functions—both remotely and in person—experiencing a new routine involving isolation or exposure to risk situations of contamination (E. D. Antunes & Fischer, 2020; Helioterio et al., 2020).\nGuilland et al. (2022), based on a study conducted in 2021, affirm that the groups that presented the highest risk of developing symptoms of anxiety and depression were frontline workers, women, individuals who, even not being on the front line, maintained contact with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 cases, and workers who were not in total isolation. In the latter case, levels of psychological distress were accentuated by the fear of personal and family contamination, especially for professionals who needed to continue performing their activities in person.\nIn this context, the field of studies and interventions in Work-Related Mental Health (SMRT) applies, which presupposes that the health-disease process is impacted by social determinants and that the physical and mental dimensions of the subject are inseparable. In this sense, studies on health and mental wear must articulate macro-social aspects, such as labor, organizational, productive, and technological transformation processes, and micro-social aspects, such as specific work situations and workers’ life trajectories, to understand the labor contribution both to health strengthening and to the intensification of suffering and the determination of mental disorder conditions (Seligmann-Silva, 2011). Work-related mental and behavioral disorders express illness processes “determined by places, time, and work actions” (Jardim et al., 2010, p. 50), not emerging from isolated factors but from pathogenic work contexts capable of generating or contributing to the emergence of psychopathological symptoms.\nIn this sense, the Laboratory of Studies on Subjectivity and Health at Work (LESSAT) at the Federal University of Ceará/Campus Sobral proposed to carry out actions focusing on promoting mental health among workers in the pandemic context as a way to prevent illnesses. Thus, at the end of 2021, it received and accepted the request to conduct a group on mental health and work with employees working in a public service concessionaire organization in the city of Sobral (CE). The requesting organization was private and operated as a citizen service center, with public service and a high flow of people in its facilities. Due to the essential nature of the institution’s service provision, the service workers did not remain in social isolation during the second wave of COVID-19, at the beginning of 2021.\nAt the end of 2021, after a year of the return to in-person activities, the company’s managers sought LESSAT, bringing reports of employee absenteeism, demands related to organizational indicators, and the need to create an in-person psychological support group addressing mental health topics. Cases of contamination and loss of close relatives due to the new coronavirus were also reported, indicating that these employees were part of the group most affected regarding mental health during the pandemic.\nLESSAT, based on the collected information, developed the proposal for a “Reflective Group on Mental Health and Work” (Silva & Bernardo, 2018) to develop a space for reflection, reception, and dialogue on care and self-care strategies in mental health, non-psychotherapeutic in nature, where workers’ experiences could be shared. This proposal was accepted by the organization’s managers in a meeting held at the beginning of 2022, with a preliminary schedule defined for the start of project actions in March of the same year.\nThus, this chapter consists of an experience report regarding this psychosocial intervention action, characterized as an advisory service as a technical product in psychology, and aims to describe and reflect on the construction and implementation of a mental health group at work within a public services organization.",

    "section": "7.2 Methodological Path",
    "text": "7.2 Methodological Path\nIn constructing this advisory action, we sought to understand psychosocial intervention as a process that begins with demand analysis, objective definition, and activity planning; then moves to execution; and finally evaluates the results obtained and suggests directions for future actions. This cycle is flexible, dialogical, and subject to changes according to the needs of the target audience (Neiva, 2010).\nLESSAT, having as one of its main objectives the study and intervention in health and subjectivity in work contexts, shares the view that workers are protagonists of their daily practice. Therefore, the choice of the intervention tool, the reflective group, is aligned with this understanding since the group can provide experiences that facilitate a cooperative attitude and an active posture towards the lived work situation, as well as point to the construction of individual and collective strategies to improve the quality of life of these individuals (Silva & Bernardo, 2018).\nFollowing these premises and understanding that workers are protagonists of their work activity (Oddone, 2020), the group’s construction happened collaboratively between laboratory members and participants. Initially, six meetings were aligned with the management, from March to August 2022, but, at the participants’ request, the project was extended by another month, totaling seven meetings (the conclusion occurred only in September of the same year). They took place in suitable rooms located within the company, with a monthly frequency and an average duration of two hours (although, in some situations, this time was exceeded).\nAs methodological strategies, conversation circles, dynamics, mediating materialities, videos, news, and Mindfulness practices were used. The meetings always included three laboratory members: one main facilitator, present throughout the group’s functioning, and two auxiliary facilitators, who varied at each meeting. A new planning occurred gradually after each meeting, respecting the participants’ movement and needs.\nField diaries and photographs (with participants’ authorization) were used to record the actions. After each meeting, experiences and perceptions were recorded to have a subsequent object for analysis, considering the facilitators’ personal information and impressions, as well as the relationships established in the field, among other aspects that could enrich the group’s construction process (Silva & Bernardo, 2018).\nAdditionally, in LESSAT’s weekly meetings, which took place after each meeting, discussions were held that contributed to the planning, continuity, and recording of activities.",

    "text": "7.3 Results\nAfter meetings with managers to prospect the demand, a LESSAT member visited the company to make the first contact with the workers, present the laboratory, the objectives, and the group proposal. This moment took place during the team’s alignment meeting, which happened daily at the end of the workday.\nAfter this visit, a virtual interest form was sent to the company’s management containing fields to be filled out with general information (name, age, email, marital status, education, position, and work time), as well as guidelines on the group’s methodology (clarifying that it was not a psychotherapeutic group), in addition to questions that contributed to the format and topics to be addressed, such as: “Why the interest in participating in the group?”; “What are your expectations?”; “What topics would you like to be addressed?”; “What types of mental health care are you looking for or have you sought?”.\nThis instrument confirmed the company’s perception regarding the developments of the pandemic concerning mental health, with this subject pointed out by the workers as one of the main topics of interest, along with the feeling of exhaustion. Factors such as stress, mental balance, stereotypes, anxiety, and depression were brought up by them, as well as the expectation of having a space to express their emotions and perceptions more openly and collectively. The need for sharing was present in all meetings, so we sought to enable contact with the topics more fluidly, respecting the group’s interests.\nInitially, the group consisted of 15 participants, considering the functioning during working hours, the need for participants to leave their workstations, and the impossibility of sectors closing completely. The selection criteria for participants were decided by the company, which was responsible for mapping the interested parties according to their sector, selecting attendants, partners from companies working in the consortium, and members of the welfare team.\nInitially, the 15 vacancies were filled, but during the process, some members left the institution, and the group ended with 11 members—one male and 10 female. A closed group format was defined, with no possibility of new members due to the continuity of actions. Therefore, attendance records were collected by the human resources department during all meetings.\nIn the first meeting, participants were welcomed through a mindfulness practice stimulating the five senses. The goal was to bring attention to the present moment, providing disconnection from the hectic work environment and greater participation in the proposed activities. The room used had a multifunctional character, allowing the team to carry out different daily activities. The mindfulness practice, whose literal meaning is full attention, was a way to make this space connect with the activities being initiated, taking the team out of an “automatic mode” of behavior.\nThe facilitators were introduced, and the group’s objectives, duration, dates, and times were presented. Subsequently, a dynamic was conducted where five teams were formed to introduce themselves and find something in common that they liked in the work environment, aiming to stimulate sharing and speaking in the group environment and opening space for participants’ expectations regarding the meetings. The topic of mental health at work was presented, using data and studies to raise awareness of its importance for future reflections. As presented by them in the initial form, the need to speak emerged as an important demand, so some planned actions did not materialize as the laboratory team prioritized this direction.\nIn the second meeting, participants were again welcomed through mindfulness activities. The room was partially lit, with serene background music, and the chairs were arranged in a circle with pieces of bubble wrap on top. In the center, a “carpet” with the same material was prepared, and participants were invited to take off their shoes and walk on it. This moment was designed to help them slow down with a relaxing and welcoming environment.\nIt was observed that they were already more attentive to the room’s stimuli (smell, sounds, images), as in the first meeting, they noticed acting in automatic mode and had difficulty observing their surroundings more sensitively. Some showed insecurity in taking off their shoes and enjoying the experience, needing encouragement in some situations—despite a sign inviting them to do so. These behaviors were later discussed collectively.\nThe main topic of the meeting was burnout and exhaustion in the work environment, as these elements had great prevalence in the form and the first meeting’s sharing. To this end, a conversation circle was organized, and in the center of the room, current reports on this subject were placed. From this, various personal situations were reported, making it possible to notice an emerging demand for speech (which influenced time management for the planned activities).\nAt the end of the meeting, constructing a coexistence contract (pending from the previous meeting) was proposed based on principles that participants considered necessary for the group’s proper functioning, as well as the establishment of rules that would guide the group throughout the period of activities. Finally, the meeting concluded with listening to participants’ perceptions about the addressed topic, setting the next date and the following month’s topic.\nAfter the first two meetings, the need to offer fewer activities and open up more for sharing was aligned in the LESSAT team’s planning meetings, allowing participants to suggest the topic based on their interests and reflections in the meetings. In each one, a snack was provided, which was available and could be accessed according to each worker’s needs. However, it was noticed that they preferred this moment to happen collectively, so the snack became part of the planning. Although they worked together daily, they said they had few interaction moments, so the practice was included considering this movement.\nThe third meeting’s theme was “coloring life” and involved a reception activity where participants were invited to paint something about their routine. For this, the room was prepared with cushions and mats on the floor in a circle, and in the center were placed posters, colored paints, brushes, and an invitation to paint. On the screen, calm music with color explosions was played, and the video “Choices” was presented, proposing a reflection on the daily work routine and self-care through the metaphor of coloring the day with simple actions.\nLater, participants were invited, through generating questions, to reflect and list individual self-care actions, involving both activities they already practiced and actions they would like to do but did not, to discriminate the obstacles preventing them. Upon finishing the list, those who felt comfortable could share their impressions of the individual activity with the group, fostering collective reflection and relating them to the self-care concepts previously presented.\nFinally, each participant was asked to choose a self-care activity to be carried out until the next meeting, aiming to encourage using the concepts outside the group, create a link between meetings, and potentially develop meaningful activities for each subject. This meeting had a more introspective characteristic, both for the activity and the collective itself (which presented a greater need for silence).\nThe fourth meeting differed by occurring in another space within the company: the break room—daily used by participants during the shift break. Workers were received with chocolates and self-care phrases, and in the center of the room were spoons with homemade brigadeiro for them to taste.\nA mindfulness practice with food was conducted, reflecting on the need to be present in simple daily activities and the relationship between presence and self-care. Many shared that they no longer felt the taste of food when eating and that, even when not at work, they ate quickly, as if they had little time to enjoy. Thus, stopping to savor the food brought this perception of disconnection from daily activities.\nAs the snack was included in the program, this moment was used for them to share the self-care activities each had chosen to practice during the meeting intervals. Some shared they had succeeded, and others had not, summarizing the process and being welcomed by other members in both situations.\nAs the third meeting saw a more introspective group, a more active dynamic was proposed. Since it occurred in June, the hot potato dynamic, which alludes to the celebrations in the Northeast during this period, was used. To the sound of quadrilha music, a box was passed around the circle, and when it stopped, the person holding it had to open and read the question. Inside the box were questions about self-care, aiming to deepen the discussions made in the previous meetings and present concepts contained in a booklet prepared by LESSAT.\nThe fifth meeting also took place in the break room at the workers’ request, and the initial dynamic consisted of offering a relaxing and introspective moment. Warm water containers and a foot soak were placed in the room, and participants were invited to remove their shoes and rest their feet in the water. From this, a reflection was made on participants’ self-care forms, which do not always require a high financial investment (as this was a factor presented as an obstacle for some in the activities chosen in the last meeting).\nThe meeting’s theme was self-compassion, the need to welcome oneself and respect one’s limits. To start this reflection, a mindfulness practice called the soothing touch (Neff, 2017) was facilitated, in which self-welcoming is performed through touch. Participants shared how they felt during the practice, the facilities and limitations related to respectful touch and self-welcoming agitation. Each participant related situations in their lives with the respect perceived in the group regarding the welcome and safety they felt when bringing reflections on self-care. At the end, an activity was proposed that consisted of writing a letter to oneself, to be done that week and reread on the eve of the next meeting.\nBetween the fifth and sixth meetings, there was a longer interval. According to the proposal, the sixth meeting was supposed to be the last, but, as mentioned earlier, the proposal was extended. The room was prepared intimately with candles and low light, and the question “Have you looked at yourself today?” was projected on the wall while Lenine’s song “Patience” played.\nThe practice aimed to seek a deeper look at oneself, the other, the limitations, and the details of being in today’s society. The dynamic of observing the other’s gaze and the sensations that can arise from this experience enabled this reconnection as a group due to the more extended period without meetings. The discomfort of observing and being observed and sustaining a gaze even with someone seen daily (bringing this perception of distance, even being physically very close) was shared.\nThe main theme was the need for rest, leisure, breaks, and leisure. To this end, a conversation circle was held after showing an episode of a series that addressed chronic fatigue in contemporary society. The circle was guided by generating questions displayed in the room’s center: “Does free time need to be productive?”; “Active life or multitasking”; “Constant need to optimize time”; “Is my leisure fun or obligation?”; “Do I feel guilty for idleness?”; “Recurrent feeling of ‘not enough time’”; “Is the cell phone rest or prison?”; “Productivity goals”; “Success or self-exploitation?”.\nThe seventh and final meeting took place in the break room and focused on closing and evaluating the project’s actions. Participants were received with dim lighting and ambient sound, with snacks served and printed photos of all meetings’ records exposed on the chairs (chosen according to each one’s preference), bringing back the memories of lived events, those who did not continue in the group, and the reflections built. During the snack, each one shared why they chose that photo with the group and their main memory of the activities.\nIn this context, the final activity was called “store in a jar.” Participants were given jars with tags available in the room, colored papers, and pens, on which they should write what they would take from that experience, that is, what they would store in a jar to retrieve later. They should name their jar, write their learnings, and share them with the group. Many brought self-care, self-respect, the need to be present in activities, and to get out of an automatic behavior pattern. They affirmed how the meetings evolved over time and how they felt welcomed and safe to share about themselves.",

    "text": "7.4 Discussion\nFrom the historical perspective of humanity, work has been one of the main drivers of social existence, enabling the subject to build identity, bonds, and support; have a purpose; obtain status and prestige; and be a source of income and subsistence. Thus, the importance and centrality of work are evident, as well as its potential to directly impact workers’ health—positively or negatively (Alencar & Merlo, 2018; Seligmann-Silva, 2011).\nSome relevant aspects perceived in the reflective group meetings demonstrated that participants were mobilized regarding mental health topics and the application of daily self-care actions. However, the lack of time and resources were pointed out as obstacles to achieving better quality of life. Regarding this, Dejours, Abdoucheli, and Jayet (1994) emphasize that workers can not only reconstruct the logic of pressures that cause them suffering but also develop defensive strategies to deal with destabilizing and pathogenic effects related to work, contributing to maintaining the current situation. Despite the ongoing difficulty in establishing a causal link between work and mental health, Souza and Bernardo (2019) point out that there is much evidence of the relationship between suffering expressions and work organization as factors that can significantly affect workers’ health.\nIt is worth noting that there were occasional interruptions during meetings due to work demands (such as when a participant was asked to leave for a moment), causing disruptions like breaking the reasoning during thematic reflections. Some workers also left the group as they received demands during meetings, even though the company agreed that they should participate fully in the group without interruptions. These events relate to a current work model increasingly directed toward productivity and maintaining high performance levels, which can generate work intensification and a sense of exhaustion (R. Antunes & Praun, 2015).\nIn this sense, although the pandemic context was the driving force for the organization to seek ways to address its employees’ mental health demands, participants did not place special emphasis on the pandemic theme during the meetings. Therefore, it is understood that the pandemic aggravated various social, health, and economic issues and brought visibility to previously socially neglected needs (such as mental health) that date back to an earlier period (Schmidt et al., 2020; Souza & Bernardo, 2019). This is because pre-pandemic data indicated that cases of depression, suicide attempts, anxiety manifestations, substance abuse, stress, emotional exhaustion, among other manifestations of suffering, were increasingly common, ranking as one of the leading causes of work absenteeism in the country (Souza & Bernardo, 2019).\nA counterpoint to the hegemonic work logic, which exalts competitiveness and productivity, is the strengthening of bonds between workers and the intermediation of social support, positively constituting a protective health factor associated with well-being (Paschoal et al., 2010). Colleagues’ support or the perception of possible support can contribute to reducing absenteeism, better performance, higher job satisfaction, greater creativity and innovation, lower turnover intention, among others (Oliveira et al., 2018). Thus, establishing a space and time where workers could interact more personally and build bonds—such as in the collective snack experience—characterized an essential moment of connection and social support perception in the group.\nThe experience also created a bond between participants and facilitators, established through shared information (many of them beyond the work context). The implementation of a methodological strategy that privileged the sharing of affections and collective interaction was fundamental for achieving this result. Using various expressive resources, revisiting topics raised in the previous meeting to establish continuity and process fluidity, and feedback from workers about how they felt and thought during the period preceding the meeting, all these elements allowed the participant a broader contact with themselves and others, establishing new relationship possibilities in the work environment.\nA positive fact is the managers’ intention to continue the project with new participant groups, indicating the recognition of the relevance of actions that favor workers’ well-being and mental health and the purpose of offering these actions within the work environment and during working hours.\nFrom the group’s realization, it was possible to perceive the importance of promoting spaces and discussions that foster reflection on the addressed topics, which comprise the interaction field between mental health and work. The strengthening of bonds, awareness of harmful behavior patterns, and the importance of self-care and self-compassion as valid strategies for dealing with pressures fomented by work conditions and organization are emphasized. A limitation of this intervention is the difficulty of reflecting on the relationship between mental health and work beyond the group, which could result in a broader process of transformation and care, involving work conditions that contribute to workers’ suffering and illness.",

In the field of education, it was necessary to start emergency teaching that kept students and teachers in their homes to avoid the spread of the virus. The remote teaching model emerged so that educational activities could continue without offering the risk of contagion (Pereira et al., 2020; I. B. da Silva et al., 2022). Despite the widespread adoption of this strategy by educational institutions, this change had an impact on teachers’ mental health indices (I. B. da Silva et al., 2022).\nDue to the abrupt modification of the work context during the pandemic, teachers had to deal with issues that impacted their mental health, such as the need to develop new skills with the use of technologies, high demands for results, and the double workload caused by demands in their home routine (Cândido et al., 2022). In this context, it was identified that receiving demands outside of working hours, losing contact with colleagues, and having difficulty separating private and work life made it difficult to carry out remote activities (Bernardo et al., 2020). It was also noted that the mental illness of this category was associated with news about deaths due to COVID-19, the pressure exerted by educational institutions, the stress load related to personal life, and the fear of death arising from the pandemic (Santos et al., 2021).\nSeveral studies showed high rates of mental disorders among teachers during the remote work period. A study conducted with 125 university teachers from the northeastern hinterland identified prevalence rates of 60% for anxiety and 50.4% for stress (Machado et al., 2022). Additionally, an investigation with teachers from the state public network of Montes Claros, Minas Gerais, found rates of 51.8% and 52.6% for anxiety and depression, respectively (Ruas et al., 2022). In a study conducted with basic education teachers (n = 203) in Peru, teachers showed rates of 87.45% for the presence of anxiety symptoms and 55.8% for the presence of depressive disorders to some degree, while female teachers showed respective rates of 70.3% and 60.4% to some degree (Betancur et al., 2022).\nGiven this scenario, the Laboratory of Practices and Research in Psychology and Education (LAPPSIE) at the Sobral campus of the Federal University of Ceará partnered with nine municipalities in the state of Ceará to conduct research aimed at evaluating the work context, mental health, and the relationship of teachers with the COVID-19 pandemic during the remote work period. This chapter aims to present the results of this study, characterizing it as a conclusive technical research report.\nSince they are neither visible nor tangible, occupational diseases associated with mental health are often not identified as problems arising from the work context. Thus, there is difficulty in establishing a causal link between the two (Borsoi, 2007). In addition, legal and social security views on mental health reinforce the idea that such problems do not stem from work but from individual reality (Sato & Bernardo, 2005).\nThus, situations of mental illness are mostly attributed to the negligence and irresponsibility of the worker. As a result, organizations attempt to conceal the pressures and demands regarding production. The idea of blaming the individual for situations of mental suffering, which are largely produced and intensified by the work context, is reinforced (M. P. da Silva et al., 2016).\nIn contrast, the field of Worker Health, which underpins this study, seeks to confront this approach that restricts the origin of illness to possible agents or risk situations present in the work environment. Such an approach fails to understand the relationships between work organization and the subjectivity of workers (Lacaz, 2007; Mendes & Dias, 1991). Therefore, the referred approach recognizes the individual as a protagonist, capable of transforming their work reality to reduce health hazards beyond work accidents and diseases. It is proposed that workers be seen as social and political actors capable of intervening in their work context, becoming knowledge producers and health care strategists (Gomez, 2011; Lacaz, 2007).",

Additionally, the questionnaire was composed of sociodemographic questions (e.g., gender, race, education level, etc.) and questions related to experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., “Did you lose friends or family members due to the COVID-19 pandemic?”).\n\n8.2.2.1 Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale\nThe DASS-21 is an instrument composed of 21 questions that assess anxiety (e.g., “I felt I was close to panic”), depression (e.g., “I had no initiative to do things”), and stress (e.g., “I felt that I was always nervous”). Respondents are instructed to indicate how much the questions applied to them during the past week. The statements range from 0 – “Did not apply at all” – to 3 – “Applied very much, or most of the time.” Thus, the higher the participant’s score, the higher the levels of anxiety, depression, and stress.\nThe scale also allows for qualitative interpretation. In this case, the scores are summed and multiplied by two, and the parameters are divided into normal (depression: 0 to 9 points; anxiety: 0 to 7 points; stress: 0 to 14 points), mild (depression: 10 to 13 points; anxiety: 8 to 9 points; stress: 15 to 18 points), moderate (depression: 14 to 20 points; anxiety: 10 to 14 points; stress: 19 to 25 points), severe (depression: 21 to 27 points; anxiety: 15 to 19 points; stress: 26 to 33 points), and extremely severe (depression: 28 points or more; anxiety: 20 points or more; stress: 34 points or more).\n\n8.2.2.2 Teacher Remote Work Context Assessment Scale\nThe EACTDR contains 33 items that assess three dimensions of the remote work context of teachers: working conditions, work organization, and socioprofessional relationships (Ferreira & Mendes, 2008). The first dimension refers to the work infrastructure, work environment, and institutional support, covering elements such as furniture, resources, tools, and organizational support (e.g., “During my work, my internet connection is poor – it frequently drops, is slow, takes time to load videos, etc.”). The second dimension concerns work management practices that guide the activity and manifest in factors such as division of labor, expected productivity, rules, times, and rhythms (e.g., “The deadlines for tasks demanded by the coordination or school management are short”). The last dimension expresses the interactions established at work, such as hierarchical, collective, and external interactions (e.g., “There are communication difficulties between teachers and principals.”). The instrument uses a frequency scale ranging from one (never) to five (always). The items express negative statements, so higher scores imply worse perceptions of the work context (Cunha, 2023).\n\n8.2.3 Procedures\n\n8.2.3.1 Data Collection\nData collection was conducted between February and June 2021. During the research period, teachers were carrying out their activities remotely, mediated by the internet. Only teachers who stated they were working in this modality were included in the study.\n\n8.2.3.2 Data Analysis\nThe RStudio software (version 2023.12.0+369) was used for data analysis. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and frequencies) were performed to verify the prevalence of the targeted variables.\n\n8.2.4 Ethical Considerations\nThis research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Vale do Acaraú State University (UVA) under CAAE number 51056621.2.0000.5053. This approval aligns with the guidelines defined in Resolutions 466/12 and 510/2016 of the National Health Council.",

    "text": "8.3 Results and Discussion\n\n8.3.1 Experiences Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nRegarding experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was observed that most teachers adopted preventive behaviors against coronavirus infection, for example, frequent and reduced access to places and services considered non-essential, such as gyms, bars, restaurants, and shopping centers. Additionally, safety measures such as the use of masks and hand hygiene were frequent practices among teachers. In this context, it is important that education departments reinforce that such precautions positively impact teachers’ physical and mental health, as maintaining healthy habits can reflect in better work performance and quality of life. Thus, lectures and meetings can be promoted so that teachers have accurate information about coronavirus prevention and are encouraged to become disseminators of this knowledge.\n\nShow the code# Table on behaviors related to the pandemic\nacademia_c &lt;- df |&gt;

Being diagnosed with COVID-19 can bring adverse consequences for teachers’ health and routine, as, besides the physical implications of the disease and the risk of death, infected people may experience greater social isolation and fear of transmitting the virus to their families (Mazza et al., 2020). Regarding losses due to the coronavirus, containment measures for SARS-CoV-2 made the grieving experience difficult, as many people could not say goodbye to their loved ones through funeral rituals (Crepaldi et al., 2020).\nIn this sense, it is essential that managers disseminate information about the importance of testing in the face of symptoms indicative of COVID-19, the need for proper medical follow-up, and the use of available vaccines. It is also understood that teachers can be affected in various ways by the consequences of the pandemic, and it is up to the administrations to promote environments that make issues such as grief less harmful.\n\n8.3.2 Teaching During Remote Work\nRegarding the teaching modality, it was found that teachers carried out asynchronous activities more frequently. It was also found that student participation in these activities was higher compared to the synchronous modality. Other studies have shown that a significant portion of students did not have quality equipment and internet to follow remote classes, which may partially explain the lower participation in real-time activities (Vazquez & Pesce, 2022).\nFurthermore, other investigations revealed that teachers also had difficulties with the use of technological resources for online work (Stang-Rabrig et al., 2022), as well as insufficient training for using digital tools. Thus, it is necessary to implement training courses that facilitate the use of technological resources by teachers and guide them on using specific didactic strategies for this context.\nMoreover, in an emergency situation, it is essential that teachers have support for acquiring adequate equipment and access to quality internet. In the case of students, the departments should provide the necessary equipment and conditions for the students to follow the classes properly.\n\nShow the codeatividades_sincronas_c &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(atividades_sincronas) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n)\n  )\n\natividades_sincronas_c &lt;- atividades_sincronas_c |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = atividades_sincronas, \n    values_from = c(n, prop),\n    names_vary = \"slowest\",\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    var = \"Conducting synchronous activities\", \n    .before = 1\n  )\n\nalunos_participam_sincronas_c &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(alunos_participam_sincronas) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n)\n  )\n\nalunos_participam_sincronas_c &lt;- alunos_participam_sincronas_c |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = alunos_participam_sincronas,\n    values_from = c(n, prop),\n    names_vary = \"slowest\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    var = \"Student participation in synchronous activities\",\n    .before = 1\n  )\n\natividades_assincronas_c &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(atividades_assincronas) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n)\n  )\n\natividades_assincronas_c &lt;- atividades_assincronas_c |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = atividades_assincronas,\n    values_from = c(n, prop),\n    names_vary = \"slowest\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    var = \"Conducting asynchronous activities\",\n    .before = 1\n  )\n\nalunos_participam_assincronas_c &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(alunos_participam_assincronas) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n)\n  )  \n\nalunos_participam_assincronas_c &lt;- alunos_participam_assincronas_c |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = alunos_participam_assincronas,\n    values_from = c(n, prop),\n    names_vary = \"slowest\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    var = \"Student participation in asynchronous activities\",\n    .before = 1\n  )\n\nensino_tbl &lt;- atividades_sincronas_c |&gt; \n  add_row(alunos_participam_sincronas_c) |&gt; \n  add_row(atividades_assincronas_c) |&gt; \n  add_row(alunos_participam_assincronas_c)\n\nensino_tbl &lt;- ensino_tbl |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_align(align = \"center\", columns = c(!var)) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(align = \"center\"),\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = \"var\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Never\",\n    columns = c(n_1, prop_1)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Rarely\",\n    columns = c(n_2, prop_2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Sometimes\",\n    columns = c(n_3, prop_3)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Often\",\n    columns = c(n_4, prop_4)\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Almost always\",\n    columns = c(n_5, prop_5)\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"Always\",\n    columns = c(n_6, prop_6))\n\n\nensino_tbl &lt;- ensino_tbl |&gt;\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = where(is.double),\n    decimals = 1, dec_mark = \",\",\n    sep_mark = \".\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  cols_label( \n    var = \"Variable\",\n    n_1 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_1 = md(\"*%*\"),\n    n_2 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_2 = md(\"*%*\"),\n    n_3 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_3 = md(\"*%*\"),\n    n_4 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_4 = md(\"*%*\"),\n    n_5 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_5 = md(\"*%*\"),\n    n_6 = md(\"*n*\"), prop_6 = md(\"*%*\")\n  )\n\n\n\nShow the codeensino_tbl\n\n\nTable 8.3: Teaching During Remote Work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nNever\nRarely\nSometimes\nOften\nAlmost always\nAlways\n\n\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%\nn\n%\n\n\n\n\nConducting synchronous activities\n142\n17,4%\n70\n8,6%\n97\n11,9%\n125\n15,3%\n96\n11,7%\n288\n35,2%\n\n\nStudent participation in synchronous activities\n148\n18,1%\n105\n12,8%\n150\n18,3%\n155\n18,9%\n113\n13,8%\n147\n18,0%\n\n\nConducting asynchronous activities\n13\n1,6%\n6\n0,7%\n26\n3,2%\n54\n6,6%\n95\n11,6%\n624\n76,3%\n\n\nStudent participation in asynchronous activities\n8\n1,0%\n14\n1,7%\n51\n6,2%\n144\n17,6%\n200\n24,4%\n401\n49,0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Work Context\nThe evaluation of teachers’ work context showed that, in terms of work organization, the time for preparing remote activities, the number of students to accompany, and the invasion of work into rest hours were the elements worst rated by teachers.

Oliveira & Pereira Junior, 2021; Petrakova et al., 2021). The global health crisis of SARS-CoV-2 accentuated and introduced new forms of intensification and precariousness of teachers’ work (Pessanha & Trindade, 2022).\nBefore the pandemic, Brazilian educational reforms implemented new models of management of teaching work that had repercussions, among other aspects, on the increase in workload, curricular changes, and pressure for results (Garcia & Anadon, 2009). These changes occurred in the quest for efficiency and productivity that entered schools, but without the necessary structural counterpoint (Pessanha & Trindade, 2022).\nDuring the pandemic, remote work required a sudden adaptation to the distance learning modality. Teachers had to learn to use digital, pedagogical, and evaluative resources compatible with the new reality, which was a challenge. Moreover, the adaptation process also impacted the balance between work and personal life, as remote activities could demand more flexible schedules and result in the invasion of rest and leisure time (Petrakova et al., 2021).\nThus, it is essential that the departments ensure teachers’ planning time and guide them so that the flexibility allowed by remote teaching does not impact an increase in workload. In addition, the demands presented by the institutions should be accompanied by resources that enable the teachers to carry out their work.\nRegarding working conditions, it was observed that the worst-rated elements were the availability and quality of technological resources, such as computers and cell phones, and the internet connection for carrying out activities.

In this sense, many of them had to deal with the lack of a computer or the need to share the equipment with other family members, which became one of the main causes of dissatisfaction with remote work, as this situation represented a disadvantage in planning and carrying out activities (R. R. V. Silva et al., 2021).\nAs presented above, emergency situations, such as teaching during the pandemic, require subsidies for teachers to acquire equipment and have access to quality internet. This measure is important for conducting classes, planning, and evaluating students.\nRegarding socioprofessional relationships, the worst-rated items pointed to the lack of teacher participation in planning and decision-making about the school.

Additionally, regarding the lower participation in decision-making and school activity planning, it is possible to assume that there was a centralization of decisions, considering the emergency nature of the situation. However, it is essential to bet on participatory management models, even in severe situations such as that faced during the period of social isolation.\nThus, it is necessary to decentralize decisions regarding the progress of classes, involving all professionals in both planning and managing activities. The possibility of sharing ideas and dividing tasks can be less harmful by avoiding an overload on managers, as well as contributing to better relationships among school community members.\n\n8.3.4 Mental Health\n\nShow the code## Dynamic data for the text: mental health\n\nind_depre &lt;- df |&gt;\n  count(depre_corte) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n),\n    var = \"Depression\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(!n) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = depre_corte,\n    values_from = prop)\n\nind_ansiedade &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(ansie_corte) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n),\n    var = \"Anxiety\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(!n) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = ansie_corte,\n    values_from = prop\n  )\n\nind_estrese &lt;- df |&gt; \n  count(estre_corte) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    prop = n/sum(n),\n    var = \"Stress\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  select(!n) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = estre_corte,\n    values_from = prop\n  )\n\nsaude_mental &lt;- ind_depre |&gt; \n  add_row(ind_ansiedade) |&gt; \n  add_row(ind_estrese) |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    ind = sum(c_across(Mild:\"Extremely severe\")),\n    ind = label_percent(0.1, decimal.mark = \",\")(ind)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  select(var, ind)\n\n\nRegarding mental health, 36,3% of the teachers presented some level of depression between moderate and extremely severe.

Studies indicate that teaching work carries a share of physical and mental wear due to its specificities, such as the need for constant focus and concentration. Additionally, professionals had to deal with existing vulnerabilities alongside the double workload, pressure for results, and excessive demands from administrations (Machado et al., 2022).\nThe lack of interaction with students and colleagues, coupled with concerns about the pandemic and the precariousness of teaching work during the period, contributed to worse mental health evaluations (Machado et al., 2022; Ruas et al., 2022). In this sense, it is important to promote mental health care for teachers, reinforcing the importance of therapy, the role of school psychologists, and partnering with teachers to transform the work environment into a health-promoting space.",

    "text": "8.4 Conclusions\nThis research aimed to profile teachers’ mental health, work context, and their relationship with the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings presented here can serve as a basis for education departments to improve the education system by promoting better working conditions for teachers.\nIt was found that most teachers were aware and adopted preventive behaviors against COVID-19, such as wearing masks and social isolation. 24% of them were part of the risk group, and 24% of them were infected with the virus. Additionally, 69% of the sample lost friends or family members to COVID-19. Regarding the teaching modality, teachers carried out asynchronous activities more frequently, and students participated more in this configuration compared to synchronous activities.\nRegarding the work context, the preparation of remote activities, the number of students to accompany, and the invasion of work into rest hours were the elements worst rated by teachers. In terms of working conditions, the availability and quality of technological resources were the worst-rated items. Concerning socioprofessional relationships during the period, it was found that teachers negatively evaluated the possibilities of participating in planning and decision-making at the school.\nRegarding mental health, 35.6% of the teachers presented some level of depression between moderate and extremely severe. Anxiety and stress showed respective rates of 46.06% and 41.29%.\nGiven the findings in this research, it is important to recognize that the education system needs to make improvements that not only address the shortcomings exposed by the pandemic context but also use resources that contribute to the performance of teaching activities. Regarding teachers’ behavior during the pandemic, it is important to hold lectures and meetings so that teachers have accurate information about coronavirus prevention, reinforcing the attitudes already taken and making them disseminators of good prevention practices. It is also timely to reinforce the importance not only of testing in the face of symptoms indicative of COVID-19 but also of using the available vaccines.\nIn an emergency situation like this, it is essential that teachers receive support for acquiring equipment and contracting quality internet services, as well as promoting training courses that facilitate the use of these tools and guide them on using the best didactic strategies for this context. For students, the departments should provide the necessary equipment and conditions for students to properly follow classes, preferably synchronously.\nIt is also essential to ensure teachers’ planning hours and guide them on the impact of increased workload caused by the flexibility of the remote teaching model. It is also important to adapt the demands presented by institutions to the pandemic period and what teachers could achieve with the resources they had at the time. The pandemic period also highlighted the need to decentralize decisions regarding the progress of classes and include professionals in decision-making about the school. Based on the data presented, it is essential that departments promote mental health care actions for professionals through lectures and other activities that provide accurate information on the subject and can reduce the strain often caused by the work context itself. ```",

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nCustomer service is essential for mediating interests between the organization and its clients. Although it may seem like an easy task, it promotes significant conflicts in the workplace. Regarding mediation work, different understandings are perceived, for example, the institution, which seeks to transform the attendant into a personification of the company’s interests, and the user, who often does not recognize the worker’s individuality and holds them responsible for all their demands (Ferreira, 2000).\nTeleoperators, in particular, have a script that describes the procedures to be performed in contact with the public. However, according to these workers, this script does not match the reality encountered when performing the activity, given unforeseen problems brought mainly by users (Ziliotto & Oliveira, 2014).\nIn a study with former telemarketing professionals from two companies in Salvador, Jesus et al. (2019) found that workers considered working conditions in the customer service sector inadequate. They pointed out pressures related to meeting goals and intimidations from managers with threats of dismissal. The authors stated that although participants deemed relationships built in the workplace important, mainly in supporting colleagues, many noted that such a sense of belonging to the collective could not combat the fear they felt from institutional rules. Additionally, some health repercussions, such as physical and mental exhaustion, were highlighted.\nTeixeira and Moreira (2021) point out that call center companies’ control over productivity and interpersonal relationships of attendants has contributed to their psychological suffering. The lack of freedom in performing activities and punishments for failing to reproduce the company’s script proved harmful to workers’ health, who began to manifest feelings of anger, fear, mental exhaustion, and anxiety. Additionally, the impacts caused by the workday, such as the limited time to go to the bathroom or have meals, were highlighted. Pereira (2022), in a study on the experiences and perspectives of former call center workers in Pernambuco, also found that operators had limited time to go to the bathroom and often needed to explain to supervisors when they took too long.\nAccording to Pacheco and Rosa (2016), in a study conducted with attendants of a medical clinic in Brasília, the main stress factors in the workplace were related to the lack of recognition in performing activities, sector conflicts, pressure from managers, and work overload. Furthermore, they found that the violent manner in which clients expressed themselves and complaints about service also contributed to workers’ stress. However, it was found that most participants dealt positively with this condition, as they did not easily let problems affect them and usually gave their best to achieve the company’s proposed goals.\nIn the Brazilian context, Rocha and Aguillera (2016) pointed out that turnover in the call center department was associated with excessive demands, control over workers’ bodies, and low salaries. The authors also highlighted the challenges for professional growth, such as prioritizing robotic and statistical work, which disregards attendants’ knowledge and potential. It was further observed that many remained in the sector to sustain personal life or academic training.\nRibeiro et al. (2019) conducted a study with 363 call center operators in companies in Montes Claros-MG. They identified higher stress levels among call center operators. This can be explained by gender issues, as women are burdened with reproductive work, i.e., care performed in the domestic environment. Additionally, these operators’ stress levels, regardless of gender, are higher compared to professionals who tend to deal with greater pressures, such as doctors and military police.\nRegarding work during the covid-19 pandemic, Brandão and Ramos’s (2023) study with teleworkers in Portugal pointed out that the virtual modality enabled companies to continue their economic activities even in a difficult scenario. Regarding participants’ perception, they presented, as a positive point, the well-being feeling when receiving good working conditions from the institutions and, as a negative point, the reduced interaction among peers.\nAdditionally, Santos et al. (2022), in a study with 652 Brazilian managers and subordinates, pointed out that many workers felt unprepared to perform their tasks during the pandemic. The authors observed that one reason for professionals’ insecurity was the limited time organizations had to transfer their activities from in-person to virtual mode.\nThis study reports consultancy provided to the customer service sector of an Autonomous Water and Sewage Service (SAAE). This SAAE was located in a city in the interior of the state of Ceará. The intervention was conducted by the team of the Laboratory of Practices and Research in Psychology and Education (LAPPSIE) at the Federal University of Ceará, Sobral Campus.\nThe SAAE had two hundred and fifty workers, who were responsible for maintaining water supply to 72,000 residences and treating sewage for over 45,000 households. The customer service sector had fourteen workers distributed among in-person, virtual, and telephone service modalities. In-person service was responsible for mediating the relationship between users and the institution, handling requests such as water connection and inspection services, sewage services, issuing duplicate bills, debt statements, and negotiations.\nVirtual service was created in 2020, during the covid-19 pandemic, to continue the services already provided by in-person service and to expand communication with users. Despite the end of the need for social isolation, this service modality was maintained. Regarding telephone service, complaints, requests, suggestions were received, and users were provided with clarifications.\nGiven this scenario, the SAAE’s people management sector identified, through employee reports, a demand related to illness and suffering arising from the work context. Among the difficulties pointed out by workers were the absence of task prescriptions and training. Instructions and rules on how to proceed were passed on by other attendants who had been in the sector longer, which created impasses, as each person’s way of dealing with demands was different.\nThus, after evaluating the demands, the intervention team proposed using the elaboration of a procedure manual as a way to mediate the discussion among workers about the activity performed. As will be seen later, this process of collective reflection on work and the construction of new ways of acting implies health improvement. Additionally, the produced document could help build prescriptions for workers and guide new attendants joining the sector.",

    "text": "9.1.1 Theoretical Foundation: Clinic of Activity\nThe intervention team used the Clinic of Activity as a theoretical and methodological framework. This methodology has the premise of transforming and understanding work as inseparable processes (Clot, 2017). Thus, unlike traditional approaches in work psychology, the intervener does not occupy an expert position, dictating or establishing procedural norms. Instead, they act as a mediator of the work analysis process, conducted jointly with workers as they develop their activities (Clot, 2013).\nIn this case, the intervention team’s role was not only to describe the activities that should be performed by the attendants and transpose them into the Manual. Their goal was to mobilize the collective of workers to assume the position of experts in their activities to collectively build successful ways of performing the work. Once this position is established, work transformation is based on developing professionals’ power to act, which is essential for promoting work health.\nFrom this perspective, work is structured through the architecture of the trade. This is responsible for shaping the particularities of each professional activity. To do this, this architecture develops through four dimensions, namely: impersonal, corresponding to the prescriptions established by the organization; interpersonal, referring to relationships between peers, service users, and supervisors; personal (style), concerning the worker, their uniqueness, subjectivity, and individual activity; and, finally, transpersonal, which corresponds to the culture of the work collective. This dimension is established through implicit norms built by workers that guide the activity similarly to official prescriptions (Clot, 2010).\nTranspersonality occurs through the memory of the work collective. Therefore, while it does not have a determined commander, it allows all workers to appropriate it and perform their work without constantly reinventing themselves in the face of each unforeseen event (Clot, 2010).",

    "section": "9.2 Method",
    "text": "9.2 Method\n\n9.2.1 Clinic of Activity as a Methodological Approach\nClot (2010) distinguishes the approach taken by the Clinic of Activity from traditional intervention strategies. While the latter consists only of recommendations, the former’s objective is to introduce a methodological tool that can become an action device for the group of workers. In this sense, work analysis seeks to help the collective reestablish their power to act, developed from the appropriation of jointly constructed tools for action. Thus, the methods employed aim to revitalize professional activity as well as the elaboration of knowledge around this dynamic.\nAt this point, it is essential to establish the distinction between performed activity and real activity to understand this clinical approach. This differentiation derives from a previous one: that between prescribed task and activity. The notion of a task refers to what should be done in a specific work situation under the conditions and rules defined by the organization (Souto et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the performed activity, which encompasses the observable dimension of action, does not encompass the real. In other words, what the worker does is a set of actions that won a conflict between various possibilities. It is precisely on these possibilities that the concept of real activity rests.\nIn this sense, the activity is no longer reduced to what is done, i.e., the performed does not hold a monopoly on the real. The set of suspended and impeded actions, along with the performed activities, form a discrepant unit. Expanding the power to act, at this point, means “using one’s experiences to make other experiences” (Clot, 2010, p. 147). Clot (2010) states that in work, the subject, when not impeded, constantly reinvents their tools, making clear the assimilation of this creative nature by the Clinic of Activity for understanding work activity (Souto et al., 2015).\nThis is why the Clinic of Activity employs indirect methods of analysis. The real activity cannot be accessed directly, either by the interlocutor or the subject. The term indirect highlights the proximity between the proposal presented here and the historical-cultural perspective, with Lev Vygotsky as its main exponent (Souto et al., 2015).\nThus, the intervention used the construction of the procedures manual to mediate attendants’ reflection on their work, to access the real activity and enable the construction of new means of action. In this sense, it was intended that the work collective’s interactions throughout the intervention would help strengthen the professional genre, considering the stylistic solutions found by each worker that could be shared.\n\n9.2.1.1 Clinic of Activity and Historical-Cultural Psychology\nVygotsky (1995) is interested, among other things, in human development and states that the foundations for this process are provided by social relations, specifically interaction and the transmission of human history, made possible by the existence of language. In this sense, individual activity has the social as its source, from which it develops. From this, the individual detaches from social modes of conduct and creates their action.\nFor Vygotsky, the sign system, a human production, occupies a privileged position for the role it plays in the institution and the social and cultural evolution of individuals (Pino, 1995). Furthermore, for the Russian author, object and method maintain a close relationship. The definition of the research problem and investigation tools occur simultaneously, so the method is both a principle and a product of the investigation. Thus, it is necessary to recognize the attribution of semiotic mediation to human psyche, in such a way that if individuals’ relationship with the world is indirect and mediated by psychological instruments, the investigation must consider this and use indirect methods, assuming a historical developmental principle (Vygotsky, 1995).\nVygotsky (1995) points out three principles that constitute the analyses developed in this perspective. The primacy of process over product is the first. The object cannot be conceived as a stable form, and since it is historically instituted, it must be investigated in motion, from the unfolding of the phenomenon in its main moments. The second principle concerns the contrast between descriptive and explanatory tasks of analysis. It is necessary to go beyond mere description of the phenomenon to explain the relationships that originate it, as the central point to be reached is the process’s genesis, not its external manifestations. In other words, what is sought is the historical and social emergence of the phenomenon. This last assertion indicates the third and final principle of this approach: genotypic analysis over phenotypic analysis (Vygotsky, 1995; Zanella et al., 2007).\nThe historical-developmental principle proposes investigating fossilized behaviors or processes, as these hold clues to complex historical structures of ancestors while announcing new formations. However, it is not about taking them in their finished form. It is necessary to impose movement on them to be understood from a genetic perspective. This guideline points to an investigation based on a social and historical perspective of the subject’s psyche, understood as a process, not as what it is, but as what it is becoming based on what has been (Vygotsky, 1995; Zanella et al., 2007).\nSimilarly, in the Clinic of Activity, directed activity is defined as the base unit of psychological work analysis. As previously mentioned, performed activity is only a set of winning reactions, so the discarded possibilities, though not directly accessed, continue to act on the subject’s action. In line with the historical-developmental methodology, to know the real activity, it is necessary to favor the development of performed activity, decrystallizing it. In this sense, one should not only understand to transform but transform to understand. Experience can only be observed from this transformation, not as an object but as a process (Clot, 2010).\nTherefore, the interest lies in the development history, its possibilities, obstacles, and principles. Thus, technical devices used in the Clinic of Activity, such as self-confrontation, instruction to the double, photo workshop (Osório et al., 2013), and letter to the sender, the latter recently developed by a student of the Professional Master’s Program in Psychology and Public Policies at the Federal University of Ceará and collaborators (Oliveira et al., 2022), act as mediators and indirectly transform the subject’s activity, moving them to a new context. The resources used allow a reentry into the action through language, which reorganizes and modifies the activity already performed by the individual and the work collective (Clot, 2010).\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Participants\nTable Table 9.1 shows the number of attendants who participated in the intervention process, with nine women and three men.

    "section": "9.3 Intervention Course",
    "text": "9.3 Intervention Course\nThe intervention began in mid-April 2022 and ended in July of the same year. During this period, ten weekly meetings, each lasting an average of 1h30, were held in person at the SAAE during the professionals’ working hours. The meetings were mediated by five facilitators, recorded in audio, and transcribed by the intervention team.\n\n9.3.1 Meeting 1\nIn the first meeting, the workers and the team of facilitators introduced themselves. Then, the intervention objectives were presented. To start the dialogues, the “Like/Dislike” dynamic was used, in which two dice are used: one with the words “like” and “dislike” and another with “do” and “don’t do.” Each participant rolls the dice and comments on an activity they perform based on the combinations of the four words, for example, “do and dislike” (Osório et al., 2013).\nOver five rounds, participants rolled the dice and commented on the sector’s activities. Marta, for example, mentioned that she liked performing the transfer service, but this was only possible when users submitted the documents correctly. The sanitary declaration was an activity that Aline performed with satisfaction because she could resolve users’ demands immediately.\nOverall, during the dialogues, participants said they could not perform some activities satisfactorily due to a lack of experience and guidance on how to proceed. This was precisely the demand that led to the intervention: the absence of prescriptions. There were also reports of being physically and verbally assaulted by customers. In one specific case, a customer called a local sensationalist news site to report Joana. Already in this first meeting, workers listed strategies to avoid customer aggression, including referring service to Marina, considered the calmest attendant on the team. Marina’s strategy was to agree with everything the user said and always apologize for the setbacks.\n\n\n9.3.2 Meeting 2\nIn the second meeting, the “Like/Dislike” dynamic continued. During the activity, Marina stated that she did not like dealing with customers’ demands that required field teams to perform operational services, such as water connection, sewage, and street leak repairs. These teams did not meet established deadlines, causing dissatisfaction among SAAE users. For Roberto, the reduction of field teams during the pandemic contributed to this situation. Additionally, Talia and Marina reported being held responsible for delays. They reported that customers were asked to evaluate the SAAE’s customer service. Thus, they received negative evaluations not for their work but because the company could not meet customers’ needs satisfactorily.\nThis discussion about customer evaluation provoked great involvement from workers. Talia, for example, emphasized that, on the one hand, direct contact in in-person service facilitated customer understanding, while in virtual service, attendants were pressured for more agility in problem-solving. On the other hand, Leonardo commented that he did not like performing water analysis service but found it convenient when he received this demand virtually. This service, which mainly involved determining whether the water was suitable for consumption, was quickly performed by the SAAE, avoiding wear and tear between customer and attendant.\nIn the final moments of this meeting, they recalled other episodes of violence they had suffered, such as the day two users threw papers at Carla and Marina because they did not accept the bill amounts and demanded that the charges be reviewed. Additionally, they emphasized that a customer threatened to assault all the attendants after being told he had to pay a high bill. Leonardo noted that women were more often assaulted because, when he worked in in-person service, he was rarely challenged or harassed.\n\n\n9.3.3 Meeting 3\nThe third meeting began with a presentation by the facilitators on tasks that should be performed by attendants. The list of assignments, which had 71 items, was obtained from the sector manager based on the services registered in the system used to record customer demands. Faced with this list, participants were surprised, as they did not imagine they performed so many activities. On the other hand, they also stated they were unaware of several procedures.\nIn light of this, Mr. Roberto explained that the list included services that were no longer performed. The existence of similar services registered with different names was also noted. Additionally, several services were not on the list. This confusion pointed again to the initial demand of the intervention: the lack of adequate task prescriptions.\nThe attendants reorganized the list to make it closer to what they performed daily. Throughout this process, questions about some activities were raised. Carla, for example, asked how to perform the water meter seal replacement service. Then, one of the more experienced participants, Roberto, described that this happened when the meter was read, and the seal was found to be tampered with, requiring the customer to be fined.\nAfter that, an activity was proposed in which they had to mark with red and gold markers, respectively, which activities were more complex and which were more frequent. After this stage, a discussion about the activities began. One of the facilitators questioned why, for example, the water connection was one of the most complex activities to perform. Roberto replied that it was a service involving the SAAE maintenance teams and, therefore, more difficult to complete.\nAfter this moment, the final activity of the meeting was to categorize the services, each with its specificity. The following classification was obtained: regarding the object, water-related and sewage-related; regarding frequency, rare; and regarding location, internal. The water-related services were: water connection, requested cut, and reconnection. The sewage-related category included: sewage connection, sewage unclogging, cesspool cleaning, and sewage inspection. Rare services, those not frequently performed, were divided as follows: social tariff, water truck removal, complete water analysis, branch relocation, and water meter seal replacement. Finally, internal services, which did not require the SAAE external team, were: bill duplicate, change of ownership, sanitary declaration, debt installment, verification, and debt statement.\n\n\n9.3.4 Meeting 4\nThis meeting continued the service categorization. The facilitators presented the previously defined categories with a slide projection. However, there were still changes, as Flávia, who was not present at the previous meeting, raised questions, and the classification was revised. After this moment, the group was asked to choose an activity to describe its step-by-step process.\nCollectively, water connection was chosen as the activity to be described. To start, the facilitator explained how this description would be: participants had to list all the procedures they performed to launch a service in the systems used and list the documentation required from customers. After this activity, participants would split up and perform the same procedure with other services.\nThe group discussion culminated with one of the facilitators questioning the group about using the computerized systems the attendants operated: Poseidon, old version; Poseidon, new version; and Ninfas. In this dialogue, one of the new participants reported having difficulty using them. Workers then tried to describe how each one worked and stated that the three systems were mostly complementary. It was also observed that system use varied depending on whether the service was in-person or virtual.\nAt the end of the meeting, one of the facilitators asked which service was more practical for users: in-person or online. Flávia replied that it depended on the customer’s profile, as some preferred online for convenience, while others liked going to the SAAE. She also stated that the demand for online service grew due to the covid-19 pandemic and noted that before it, the in-person queue was long, requiring more work from the sector. After the pandemic, she noticed that customers’ visits to the SAAE decreased.\n\n\n9.3.5 Meeting 5\nIn the fifth meeting, the service descriptions continued, but now this was done in pairs of workers. At the end of the meeting, each pair would present their description to the group, and a new discussion would be held. For this purpose, scripts were provided where attendants chose a service to describe: name, respective code in the system, requirements for individuals or companies, necessary documents, and procedures.\nRoberto suggested that the pairs consist of one worker from in-person service and another from virtual service, as he considered the performance in each modality different. The dialogue between pairs lasted an average of 15 minutes.\nDuring the collective work discussion, one topic generated controversy among participants: the need to archive documents requested from users. Aline reported that in virtual service, documents were archived in the system, and Dário said that in in-person service, archiving was required at the company. Different procedures were adopted, as in virtual service, documents were received via WhatsApp, and in in-person service, customers had to present original documents and deliver copies. Flávia, on the other hand, reported another procedure: if the user was the account holder and it was updated, she only requested their identification document. The debate generated controversy among the group participants, as they operated differently regarding document request and archiving.\n\n\n9.3.6 Meeting 6\nThe service descriptions continued in the sixth meeting. Carla and Leonardo commented on the sewage inspection, which aimed to verify if there was a collector network near the user’s residence and inform if the service fee was being charged incorrectly. When asked about the refund of incorrect charges, Flávia replied that reimbursement needed to be requested by the user, as the suggestion never came from the SAAE. This statement led the attendant to describe the reimbursement process, in which the customer wrote a handwritten request informing the charging period, a document sent to the management, and finally, the discount was recorded in the system to be applied to the next bill. The facilitator asked if they were guided by the SAAE on using this strategy. Flávia then replied no, as she thought inducing the user to produce a request opposed the institution she worked for.\nNear the end of the meeting, Carla presented the service of clandestine water inspection and highlighted that when an infraction was confirmed, the registration and inspection sector was responsible for applying the fine, and the customer service sector for the installment and reconnection request. From the discussion, the facilitator asked if the number of installments was determined by the attendants, as they expressed empathy for users. For example, when the participant understood a customer’s case who did not know they were committing an infraction by placing a faucet before the meter. Flávia explained that this was at the management’s discretion. Additionally, she emphasized that with management changes, the team always had to adapt to new procedures. Furthermore, Leonardo agreed with his colleague and stated that this information was not passed on to everyone, so the uninformed needed to adapt as cases arose.\n\n\n9.3.7 Meeting 7\nIn this meeting, the activities presentations began. Dario started the activity by describing two services: the standpipe and the water shortage. In this presentation, some problems with the standpipe installation activity were discussed. Rita mentioned a situation where a user did not want to pay for the service and called it stressful.\nNext, the discussion focused on deadlines. Rita explained that she did not usually give exact deadlines to users. According to her, some services were performed by the external team, so attendants had no control over whether the activity would be completed within the expected date. Talia, on the other hand, called the standpipe replacement activity one of the most complicated, as deadlines were usually not met, causing user dissatisfaction. However, her performance differed from Rita’s, as she liked to inform deadlines to customers.\nAt the end of the meeting, the same debate caused controversies among the group. Marta reported that in some situations, attendants informed different dates to users. She cited a situation where Carla gave a 15-day deadline. Days later, the customer returned with the same problem, and Marina provided another deadline. According to their report, the customer was dissatisfied with the situation.\n\n\n9.3.8 Meeting 8\nAt the beginning of the eighth meeting, internal services and the description of the last pending service: occasional services, were presented. Attendants chose to do this activity individually, but Rita and Dario chose to do it in pairs.\nDuring the presentation of internal services, they discussed how services were performed during the pandemic. Marta mentioned that it was unexpected, as she had never served users virtually. Flávia also reported that it was very challenging initially, as there were many complaints, mainly due to the delay in virtual service, but overall, the SAAE managed to overcome the limitations of the context, offering quality service.\nIn this perspective, Dario mentioned that people were still afraid of covid-19, so they preferred online service. Continuously, one of the facilitators asked him how he reacted to the virtual model. The participant reported that he had to adapt to keep up with work evolutions but preferred in-person service. He even called technological tools, such as cell phones and computers, “cold” since he did not have the same interaction with users as at the counter.\nAt the end of the activity, Flávia mentioned that during the week, a user got irritated and went in person to complain about the delay in WhatsApp service. She explained that due to high demand and handling service requests in the order of receipt, delays were normal. Additionally, she reported that she became friends with this user, which facilitated problem-solving as she managed to handle the irritation.\n\n\n9.3.9 Meeting 9\nAt the beginning of the ninth meeting, the group discussed validating the manual, titled Standard Operating Procedure. The facilitator presented the progress of the first version and revisited issues that had arisen in previous meetings, such as the requirement for document copies and the establishment of deadlines. Then, the facilitator asked about the deadline for water connection, as participants had not reached a consensus in previous meetings. Marina replied that she usually said between 45 to 60 days to avoid upsetting the customer when the deadline was missed. Participants continued the discussion and emphasized other skills related to deadlines. For example, Flavia and Marta explained to the user that the high service demand required more waiting time. Carla clarified that the water connection did not depend solely on the customer service sector but also on the field team. Marina also pointed out that the institution served the city and districts, causing service completion delays.\nThe discussion culminated in questions about how to interact with users when determining waiting times. The facilitator asked what motivated the team to develop these strategies. Flávia replied that they were created as a defense mechanism, as users usually expected immediate feedback from the service, so they needed to be creative to solve problems. Marta agreed with her colleague and said she felt embarrassed when the user returned to the SAAE for the third time.\nAt the end of the activity, participants reported that user pressure also affected their personal lives. For example, Flavia mentioned that a customer approached her at church and asked if she could give her private number to resolve work issues. Carla recalled a day when she was sick at the Emergency Care Unit and had to explain to a user that she could not answer their questions. Finally, Rita and Marta said they were chased on the street by a user with questions after being observed by security cameras. Overall, during the discussion, the group pointed out that the challenges faced in the customer service sector were associated with the lack of organization in the administrative sector, as field teams did not meet the deadlines established by the institution. Additionally, Carla emphasized that observing colleagues’ work styles was a way to avoid future embarrassments in in-person service.\n\n\n9.3.10 Meeting 10\nIn the final meeting, the manual validation continued. The activity began with presenting the requested cut service and analyzing the procedures adopted in other services. During the validation, there was a discussion about the definition of the water reconnection service, as most participants had different definitions. Rita suggested not including a definition in the document, as each understood it differently. On that occasion, one of the facilitators said they would speak with management about this specific case and later give them feedback.\nIn the final moments of the activity, the collective decided to change some procedures. One of the facilitators commented on the complexity of services, as they had many details. Rita agreed, stating that many procedures changed over time. Additionally, she pointed out that when performing the activities, everything seemed simple, but describing them required considerable effort. This statement was also supported by the other attendants. Finally, they were informed about the end of the meetings and the presentation of the manual to the institution’s management.",

    "section": "9.4 Discussion",
    "text": "9.4 Discussion\nSome themes stood out during the meetings, such as the lack of prescriptions and user aggression, especially against female attendants. Work during the covid-19 pandemic was also discussed.\nIt was noted that precarious, changeable prescriptions, depending on management, and sometimes restricted to a thirty-year-old institutional regulation led to a lack of standardization of procedures. Workers, thus, had to rely almost exclusively on guidelines shared among themselves. In this way, the interpersonal dimension of the trade ended up substituting the impersonal dimension. Workers relied on informal rules, but there was not yet a strongly established professional genre.\nThis resulted in providing imprecise—sometimes contradictory—information to service users, such as the possibility of installment plans for overdue bills, deadlines for service performance, among others. Leal et al. (2015) found a similar situation when they found that the lack of training in customer service caused workers to feel incapable of proceeding.\nRegarding user aggression, SAAE workers, notably women, showed extreme politeness to avoid more severe conflicts. In such situations, they apologized or referred the service to the professional considered the calmest in the sector. These behaviors are similar to the findings of Sznelwar and Abrahão (2012). The authors pointed out that when constrained or prevented from acting, professionals adopted a more automated approach to customers to avoid their aggressiveness leading to more damaging situations.\nThus, the transpersonal dimension of the trade manifested through strategies that were part of the collective memory and contributed to facing adversities. However, even using this set of knowledge built by them over the years, they felt that other skills needed to be employed to alleviate work constraints. In this sense, they began to describe individual actions that helped develop daily activities, such as mentioning the high service demand and the sector’s dependence on field teams.\nThrough these reports, which described the actions undertaken during violence contexts, the intervention also gave visibility to the personal dimension of the trade. As the group’s ways of acting became insufficient to deal with situations, the professional style emerged to transform and revitalize the genre (Clot, 2010).\nIt should also be considered that the administrative sector’s disorganization impacted professionals’ personal lives, as their leisure time was invaded by work-related demands. Leal et al. (2015) pointed out that customer behavior should be attributed to institutions, as their irritation was mostly related to long waiting times.\nAdding to what was exposed, a focus on the female gender in customer service sectors. Venco (2009) considered that the marked hiring of women was associated with characteristics socially attributed to them, such as patience, delicacy, and empathy, i.e., their actions were reduced to feminine attributes. Additionally, Nogueira (2009) pointed out that female workers were subjected to excessive control over time, the number of tasks performed, and the results obtained. She also emphasized that the pursuit of customer satisfaction posed greater health risks, as they needed extra emotional effort to overcome daily difficulties without abandoning institutional rules.\nWhen discussing work during the covid-19 pandemic, virtual service was mentioned as complex by attendants. The abrupt adaptation to the new modality was seen as a factor that hindered activity development, as many participants had no previous experience with telework or were not used to digital tools. Generally, these adversities led to work fatigue and overload.\nThe exposed situation aligns with the findings of Filardi et al. (2020). The authors pointed out that the lack of training made the work appropriation process through the internet more unpleasant for workers. Conversely, Brandão and Ramos (2023) found that when training was offered, it provided workers with a positive perception of their role, mainly in the sense of independence and satisfaction with the activity.\nAs it was a new work arrangement, there were also complaints related to the change in interaction with users. Thus, they demonstrated that remote contact did not guarantee customer understanding, as they could not serve them more affectionately, as in in-person service. However, some attendants approved the current service, considering that the customer’s return to the service caused emotional strain.\nIn line with participants’ reports, Santos et al. (2022) pointed out that virtual service prevented establishing more empathetic relationships between attendants and users. The authors also showed that telework negatively affected demand resolution, as professionals could not understand customer complaints and consequently delayed feedback. Baccilli and Cruz (2021) noted that another negative aspect was related to work overload due to the increased number of demands received via WhatsApp and Email. However, operators felt safer, as digital platforms could record dialogues and recover customer interactions if necessary.\nOverall, evaluating the intervention’s methodological proposal, the employed techniques expanded group dialogue. An example is that the various changes in the sector, such as services that were no longer provided, were noticed from the interactions the intervention allowed the work collective.\nFurthermore, the dialogues allowed a return to the activity that transcended its immediate performance, as attendants realized the decisions they made in performing activities that were not immediately recognized. This was highlighted when one participant reported the effort required to describe them and assess what was done beyond immediate execution.\nRegarding customer interactions, it was observed that attendants, from the discussions that occurred during the intervention, were confronted with their activities as they could narrate not only what they performed but also what they could not do. Thus, it was possible to access the real activity, which is not limited to the performed activity but comprises the process that leads the worker to decide how to proceed. In this sense, the real activity refers to “…what is not done, what cannot be done, what should be done, what one would like to do, and what is done without needing to.” (Clot, 2007, p. 216).\nAdditionally, the manual’s construction provided a space for controversies among workers, especially in the dialogues related to adopting different procedures for task performance. It was noted that during disputes, the professional genre was strengthened, as it was possible to discuss the attendant’s trade, which differed from the collective’s pre-intervention stance. Thus, controversy implied expanding dialogue, ensuring that other experiences were developed and transformed (Clot, 2017).",

    "section": "9.5 Final Considerations",
    "text": "9.5 Final Considerations\nThe study aimed to report a consultancy carried out in the customer service sector of the Autonomous Water and Sewage Service (SAAE), using the construction of a procedure manual as a dialogue mediator among workers. Moreover, it aimed to create a space where they could reflect on the attendant’s trade, different ways of acting, working conditions, and health repercussions. The Clinic of Activity was used as a theoretical and methodological framework to observe the renewal of the professional genre and the collective transformation of work.\nAmong the themes discussed by participants, the absence of prescriptions was noted, resulting in the transmission of imprecise information to customers. Additionally, adversities related to violence experienced by female participants and the strategies developed to deal with these situations emerged. Besides these, the discomfort about adopting virtual service during the covid-19 pandemic and its repercussions on user interaction emerged in attendants’ discourse.\nStrengths and potentialities were noted in this investigation. Group engagement was prevalent in all meetings, and workers led the discussions, taking on the role of experts in the trade. Additionally, there was group recognition regarding experience and strategy exchanges. In this context, workers learned from each other, regardless of their time at the institution. This dynamic points to an increase in participants’ power to act. It was also observed that the intervention provided greater interaction between in-person and online service professionals, as they did not usually have direct contact to share and discuss different ways of acting.\nRegarding the intervention’s limitations, the reduced time workers had to discuss their activities is highlighted, as there were changes in the initially idealized schedule due to holidays and other field-related setbacks. Additionally, attendants’ fatigue was noted, as activities occurred on Fridays at the end of the week’s shift. Moreover, the space offered by the institution for the group was inadequate, as it was in an area of free access for other worker categories. This partly compromised participants’ freedom of expression. Regarding intervention contingencies, there was a high turnover of participants, as those returning from vacation joined ongoing discussions.\nFinally, it is worth noting that future studies can be conducted in the SAAE customer service sector, for example, analyzing workers’ power to act and health after validating the Procedure Manual and how the document has impacted their socio-professional interactions. Additionally, studies and interventions related to violence against female attendants are also warranted, considering that this points to a gender issue that deserves further discussion.",

    "text": "10.1 Introduction\nThe Nucleus for Studies and Extension on Subjectivation and Sexuality (SuSex) is linked to the Psychology undergraduate course at the Federal University of Ceará, Sobral campus. SuSex’s general objective is to promote gender equity and respect for sexual diversity. Through our actions, we seek to produce resistance against processes of homogenization and standardization of ways of living. In this sense, this study presents the experience report of producing and developing a technical consultancy service on sexual and reproductive rights and health in public social assistance facilities.\nThe technical service involves conducting actions with society and institutions, particularly consultancy, which is the act of “assisting, helping, supporting, coadvising, or collaborating with a specific process. In consultancy, problems are identified, and solutions are implemented with the direct participation of the consultant interfering in the processes” (Bastos et al., 2016, section EIXO 3).\nThe consultancy involved producing four workshops aimed at promoting sexual and reproductive health rights, specifically with cis women1, in social assistance facilities, including two at the Social Assistance Reference Center (CRAS) and two at the Specialized Social Assistance Reference Center (CREAS), during 2022. The history of reproductive rights is recent, and sexual rights even more so, having the feminist and LGBTQI movements as fundamental actors in their configuration and production. Thus, through sexual and reproductive rights, a political and ethical stance was introduced into the debate on reproduction and sexuality (Rohden & Russo, 2011). These two social movements share the questioning of universal categories, scientific truths, the naturalization of sex, and the normalization of sexuality, contrasting with the biologizing and pharmacological perspective of biomedical knowledge.\nIt was through the deconstruction of motherhood as an obligation, the struggle for the right to use contraceptive methods, and abortion that feminists worldwide began to build their agendas on reproductive rights. These seek to link reproductive needs not only to health but also to human rights (Ministério da Saúde, Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, Departamento de Atenção Básica, 2013). Reproduction ceases to be discussed solely in its demographic aspect, which exclusively falls on the woman and her body, and begins to encompass ethical, social, and cultural issues (Corrêa & Petchesky, 1996). Reproductive health is part of reproductive rights and defends the autonomy and right to choose whether, when, and how often to reproduce.\nMeanwhile, sexual rights imply respect for different types of sexual expression, autonomy over one’s body, and sexual equality. The notion of sexual health brings to the fore other elements unrelated to reproductive health, such as the expression of sexuality without coercion, violence, discrimination, and the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well as mutual respect, pleasure, safety, self-esteem, and freedom of sexual expression (Ministério da Saúde, Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, Departamento de Atenção Básica, 2013).\nIn 2005, Brazil launched the National Policy on Sexual Rights and Reproductive Rights, resulting from the articulation between the Ministries of Health, Education, Justice, and Social Development and Fight Against Hunger; and the Secretariats of Policies for Women, Policies for the Promotion of Racial Equality, and Human Rights. This and other strategies advocate respect for autonomy, maximizing benefits and minimizing harm, equity, and respect for cultural, ethnic, sexual, religious, etc., diversity. Conservative and moralizing perspectives on sexuality have opposed the changes driven by social movements, so many debates that have occurred in the political sphere and the struggles for sexual and reproductive rights seem not to reach or are blocked (Rohden et al., 2014).\nWhile biomedical and pharmacological knowledge advocates the medical discourse as the only true one and drug treatment as the most efficient, the field of sexual and reproductive rights argues that each person should decide on the uses, sexual, reproductive, or otherwise, of their bodies. Thus, we will describe and analyze the process of creating care practices aligned with sexual and reproductive rights in social assistance, guided by four ethical principles: personal integrity, individuality, equality, and respect for diversity (Rohden et al., 2014).",

    "section": "10.2 How We Do It",
    "text": "10.2 How We Do It\nThe consultancy action was developed in partnership with the Human Rights and Social Assistance Secretariat of the city of Sobral, Ceará, in October and November 2022. Four workshops were held, two at the Social Assistance Reference Center (CRAS) and the other two at the Specialized Social Assistance Reference Center (CREAS). The target audience for the CRAS workshops were women served by the Comprehensive Family Protection and Assistance Service (PAIF) and at CREAS, mothers of young people serving socio-educational measures in an open environment. In total, about 30 cis women participated, all in poverty, most of them black and brown.\nWorkshops on sexual and reproductive health with an educational character were held in the city’s social assistance facilities, aiming to construct new healthier ways of living based on collective care through the dialogued circulation of scientific knowledge. The workshops used materials such as internal and external condoms (obtained through a partnership with the Sobral Reference Center for Infectious Diseases - CRIS), paper, and colored pencils. The activities were structured based on the following organization:\nThe women were divided into 2 groups, each with at least two extensionists, one responsible for facilitating and mediating the workshop, and the other for observing and recording the activity in the field diary. The activity started with an introduction dynamic where the women drew or wrote what they liked to do most when they were teenagers and/or before becoming mothers while songs they said they liked to listen to were played. Then, they shared their drawings, stating their name and explaining what they drew and wrote.\nNext, cards with the following themes, to be addressed in the workshop, were presented:\n\nSexually Transmitted Infection (STI),\ncontraception,\nmotherhood,\nPink October,\npractical activity represented by the image of a “little flame.”\n\nThen, they drew each theme, revealing the cards to perform the activity. We describe below the different dynamics used for each cited theme:\n\nSTI – “catch or don’t catch” dynamic where some possible STI infection situations are taken from an envelope, and participants answer “if you catch or don’t catch” STI in the described cases. The cases were:\n\nYou don’t catch it from pool water; sweat; toilet seat; towel; soap; cutlery; glasses; reused plates and cups; and mosquito bites;\nYou catch it from oral sex; already used needle or syringe when injecting drugs; reused needle for tattoos and piercings; reused dental instruments; also listed the possibility of transmission during pregnancy; at birth; during breastfeeding.\n\nContraception – to address the theme, a fictional case about a sexual relationship where the condom broke was read. This way, it is possible to address emergency prevention and inform how to access contraceptives available in the Unified Health System (SUS), as well as how to act in such cases.\nMotherhood – the theme was addressed through triggering questions such as:\n\n“When a woman becomes a mother, what does society expect from her?”;\n“Are the expectations of how mothers should be nowadays the same or different from those of the past?”;\n“Are the expectations of what it means to be a mother different from what is expected of a father? How?”.\n\nPink October – At the CRAS and CREAS request, due to the action scheduled for October, we added the “Pink October” theme to discuss breast cancer prevention. To this end, we asked questions to promote discussion about health care, such as:\n\n“What is the best way to detect breast cancer?”;\n“At what age is breast cancer most common?”;\n“What is the best way to prevent breast cancer?”.\n\nLittle flame – The practical activity illustrated by the Little Flame card is used to discuss condom use. Initially, participants are asked if they know how to use internal and external condoms. If not, they are invited, if they feel comfortable, to demonstrate condom use, and the extensionists help demonstrate the correct use.\n\nAfter all the cards were drawn, and the themes discussed, the meeting ended with distributing internal and external condoms, as well as informational leaflets on health care.\nThe entire consultancy experience was recorded in field diaries produced by the extensionists. This recording strategy is based on the debate on observation “in” everyday life proposed by Spink (2007), where it is understood that we are part of this “community and share norms and expectations that allow us to assume a shared understanding of these interactions” (p. 07).\nThe workshop activity seeks to break with vertical intervention models, where participation is limited to responding to instruments. In this perspective, knowing and doing are placed in the same field and process (Passos & Barros, 2009). We adopt as our epistemological basis the queer perspective (Butler, 2010), post-structural feminism (Haraway, 2009), with attention to aspects related to intersectionality (Piscitelli, 2008) and post-coloniality (Castro-Gómez, 2005). We seek to produce socially situated knowledge and practices aligned with social commitment and ethical-political-scientific justice. In this sense, we question the social inequalities and hierarchies produced based on social markers of difference.",

    "section": "10.3 Contraception: Discourses and Practices",
    "text": "10.3 Contraception: Discourses and Practices\nWomen have not always been solely responsible for the reproductive process or its interruption. In different cultures and historical periods, researchers show that abortion and infanticide were accepted and had collective support, not being crimes punishable by law. Such practices, in some cultures, were associated with maternal courage, preventing unwanted beings from being condemned to life (Matos, 2003). Abortion, infanticide, and child abandonment were common practices during Antiquity and the Middle Ages. While in Antiquity, the father decided whether to accept the child, in the Middle Ages, this function passed to the mother, who could then be questioned and condemned by the Church as a sinner (Vieira, 1999).\nIn modern times, there is a shift in the perception of abortion, infanticide, and child abandonment, as these practices began to be associated with impoverished women, no longer with men or even couples. Women became the main responsible for reproductive planning and, thus, the dissemination of contraceptive methods such as “withdrawal, water douches, sponges moistened with disinfectants placed at the bottom of the vagina, gut and rubber condoms, and control tables” (Matos, 2003, p. 113). Since antiquity, different contraceptive methods have been known to humanity, but only from the 20th century did contraception techniques begin to focus on women’s bodies (Pedro, 2003). We see that, even before birth control pills and tubal ligation, women became the main responsible for birth control.\nIn Brazil, the Ministry of Health only began distributing contraceptive methods in the 1980s with the implementation of the Women’s Comprehensive Health Assistance Program (PAISM). Before that, initially, the distributed materials came from donations from other organizations, including international ones like the World Bank. Only in 2007 did Brazil publish the National Family Planning Policy, which provides for the distribution of condoms and contraceptives, sex education, and actions in reproductive health.\nDuring the workshops held at CRAS and CREAS, we noticed that the themes that most mobilized women’s speeches were motherhood, contraception, the use of internal and external condoms, and, therefore, we will focus on describing and analyzing the dynamics involving the last two themes in this text, namely, the fictional case and the little flame. Many women who participated in the workshops did not know what contraception meant, and after the extensionists’ explanation, they concluded that it was synonymous with not “getting pregnant,” a term commonly used in the Northeast to refer to a pregnant woman, who is called “pregnant.”\nThe discussion on contraceptive methods used the reading of a fictional case of a young woman who had a sexual relationship in which the condom broke as a mediator. After reading the fictional case, we noticed that women demonstrated knowledge of different ways to avoid pregnancy, including the hormonal “chip,” but few knew about the morning-after pill. The logic present in most women’s discourse was that the fictional character should wait and see what would happen; if she got pregnant, she should continue with the pregnancy because it was “not the end of the world.”\nWe notice today that, for the more economically favored population, having children is associated with the idea of gratification, so future parents should wait for the right moment to procreate, i.e., when the child is no longer an obstacle to personal and professional achievements, besides the imperative of having children only if they can provide them with the best possible living conditions (Altmann, 2007). Meanwhile, among the impoverished population, having children is generally associated with the transition to adulthood, which is valued because being an adult is related to the world of work and obtaining income and social and financial independence (Altmann, 2007). Understanding these intersectional aspects is essential to developing effective strategies for promoting sexual and reproductive rights and health, referencing each group of women’s concrete reality.\nA younger participant said she knew about the morning-after pill and reported that her 15-year-old sister became pregnant in her first sexual relationship due to a lack of communication with her other sisters, who suggested using this method after unprotected sex. Another participant reported that her daughter was a “morning-after pill baby” because she used the method incorrectly, taking two pills simultaneously without waiting the necessary time between doses. We explained in the workshop the proper way to use the morning-after pill and the method’s effectiveness, which, if used correctly, prevents the egg’s fertilization.\nUsing and popularizing information about contraceptive methods would be one strategy to prevent unplanned and/or unwanted pregnancy, marking an important milestone for women’s lives in general and the feminist movement, as women could choose if and when to get pregnant. However, gender, race, and class inequality still permeate the reproductive process. Despite the public policies’ free distribution of contraceptive methods, this alone cannot provide sexual freedom, reproductive rights, and women’s autonomy. In this sense, it is necessary not only to ensure women’s sexual and reproductive rights, defended by the Cairo Conference (1994), but also to guarantee human rights and social justice for women from ethnic minorities and impoverished backgrounds (United Nations, 1995).\nThe discourse that preventing unwanted pregnancy is solely a woman’s responsibility was prominent in the workshops, brought up in statements like “it’s your fault” after a participant’s teenage pregnancy story, “a woman only gets pregnant if she wants to,” “didn’t prevent,” “didn’t take care,” “now has to face the consequences,” “today a woman only gets pregnant if she wants to, there are many free methods.” Pregnancy appears in these statements as a form of punishment for women with an active sex life and as their exclusive responsibility. Even using contraceptive methods, if pregnancy occurs, it is still the woman’s fault for not “taking proper care.” These statements align with the idea that it is important to avoid pregnancy, but if it is not possible, “a child is a blessing from God.”\nWe observed that the popularization and increased availability of contraceptive methods, for some economically advantaged women with greater access to information and health services, made possible the emergence of new family and marital arrangements. These women began to have more freedom to exercise their sexuality more freely and detached from the reproductive process, but if something goes wrong, i.e., if the woman gets pregnant, she will be the only one to blame, regardless of her class or race (Pedro, 2003). Contraceptive methods, while allowing women to control their reproduction and “future,” can also become instruments of control over their bodies to regulate birth rates and hold them responsible for reproduction.\nSeveral women reported having their first pregnancy when they were still minors. One of them commented that when she lost her virginity to her child’s father, she made him use two condoms out of fear of getting pregnant. She continued, saying that thinking and talking about sex always evoked feelings of shame at that time, and she did not want to discuss it with her parents. The extensionists warned that using two condoms is more unsafe as it facilitates breaking them, to which the woman responded that they did it out of lack of information, believing it would help them have safe sex.\nIt is important to highlight the lack of equity among women of different classes and races. According to Perpétuo (Perpétuo, 2000), black women start their sexual life and become pregnant earlier than white women and have more children. Black women have limited access to contraceptive methods, often using none to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These women also have little knowledge about reproductive physiology, reflecting a high failure rate when using contraceptives.\nTaking as a reference the issues that articulate gender, class, and race, we can question the model instituted in our society that marks who are the subjects fit to be mothers, their age, and their economic and social condition. Social conventions dictate that pregnancy is only legitimate if it results from marriage. Although women’s role in society is still associated with their reproductive activity, we can see that this process has been invested with normative standards guiding when and how often women should be mothers. These rules are mainly associated with race, income, marital status, and, in recent decades, age has also been a significant factor in this regulation. In this sense, sexual and reproductive rights are linked to economic inequality, political interests, eugenic practices, geopolitics, territorial issues, and gender inequality (Preciado, 2008).\nThese reports show that although motherhood has ceased to be an unquestionable destiny for many women, especially white and economically advantaged ones, due to the spread of contraceptive methods, this scenario is not a reality for many Brazilian women, especially black and poor women. The increased access to contraceptive methods did not happen homogeneously among women, according to the Ministry of Health\n\n“one relevant data on the issue related to black women’s health is that they have less access to quality health services, gynecological care, and obstetric assistance, whether in prenatal care, childbirth, or postpartum” (Ministério da Saúde, Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, Departamento de Atenção Básica, 2013, p. 73).\n\nThus, the female body remains a concern and control target for the women themselves, their partners, doctors, and rulers due to their reproductive capacity. This concern often ends with using definitive techniques, such as tubal ligation and hysterectomy. The tubal ligation process also affects women’s bodies differently according to age, race, and social class. In 1986, a special supplement of the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) indicated that the highest rates of sterilized women in Brazil, aged 15 to 54, were found in the states of Maranhão (75.4%), Goiás (71.3%), and Pernambuco (61.4%), indicating the prevalence of surgical sterilization in the Northeast region, where the black population is the majority (Roland, 1991).\nVasectomy could be another definitive option for birth control, but despite being a simpler sterilization method than tubal ligation, it is less common (Ministério da Saúde, Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, Departamento de Atenção Básica, 2013). One woman during the workshop reported having four children and not wanting more, but after her partner suggested a vasectomy, she disagreed because even though it was simpler, the husband might want more children if they separated.\nAnother woman reported that her brother has three children, each with a different mother, and although he faces problems with all three due to legal issues, he refused to have a vasectomy when she suggested it. According to her, the brother feared “ceasing to be a man” (losing the ability to have erections). The women said they knew there was no connection between vasectomy and sexual performance, but it is common for men to repeat this discourse.\nThe lower incidence of vasectomy is linked to masculinity standards, which distance men from family planning, the reproductive process, and health care. Many men believe that after the procedure, they will lose their erection and sexual pleasure (Casarin & Siqueira, 2014). Thus, despite the surgical risk, women continue to undergo tubal ligation, even though other alternatives involve men in the reproductive process.\nThe presentation of the use of internal and external condoms was one of the activities that most mobilized women’s participation and curiosity. Many did not know about the use of internal condoms and their benefits and had never seen or touched this material. Generally, women did not know about internal condoms, but some younger ones had heard about them at school. Most knew other contraceptive methods, especially hormonal contraceptives. It is important to highlight the dual function of condoms, which, in addition to preventing pregnancy, also prevent STIs and HIV.\nDuring the condom distribution at the end of the workshops, several women took both types of condoms, stating they would test the use of internal condoms since they could handle them. The greater curiosity about the internal condom can be related to discussions about motherhood and contraception, as women reported being responsible for preventing pregnancy, and if they became pregnant, it was their responsibility to care for the children. Some said they might have difficulty using the internal condom, but others liked having this option because “even when the man doesn’t want it, it’s already there,” and another said, “who has to like (the internal condom) is me, not my husband.”\nContraceptive methods enabled many changes in women’s lives, especially for white and economically advantaged women, being both a source of sexual freedom, an important aspect for the feminist struggle, and a tool for moral control of reproduction. The historical hierarchy between men and women is still present in the family, work, and social space they occupy. Thus, we highlight that sexual and reproductive rights alone cannot guarantee gender equity. It is also important to note that how people exercise their sexuality, using or not using contraceptive methods, is not only a private matter but also a state interest in birth control (Ministério da Saúde, Secretaria de Atenção à Saúde, Departamento de Atenção Básica, 2013).\nThe excerpts of speeches from women assisted by SUAS, mostly black and poor women, show that, throughout history, the spread of quality information on sexual and reproductive rights and health has not succeeded in bringing together women from different social backgrounds, often lacking true concern from social movements with working-class women. Moreover, we need to be careful in our actions in the field of sexual and reproductive rights, as sometimes the arguments developed by family planning advocates are based on blatantly racist premises, such as the interest in reducing birth rates among the poorest population, especially black people. The history of this movement leaves much to be desired in contesting racism and class exploitation (Davis, 2016).\nReproduction is not only an individual issue but also a matter of population control, as it demands investments in public health, social assistance, and public education, for example. Thus, reproductive processes have been historically controlled as they become a social problem that should be governed by state actions and public policies (Preciado, 2008).",

    "text": "10.4 Final Considerations\nThe right to sexual and reproductive health involves several elements, from individual choice, access to public policies, social justice, and distribution of safe contraceptive methods, etc. This discussion needs to consider the different realities of women, especially those in situations of social vulnerability, assisted by social assistance policies. Informed and equal access to sexual and reproductive rights is a fundamental prerequisite for the emancipation of women in general. Since the right to birth control is obviously an advantage for women of all classes and races.\nTherefore, it is necessary to reinforce the importance of technical consultancy activities, such as those carried out by university extension, as they enable reflection and access to information in a way that values women’s knowledge on the subject, expanding their repertoire. It is through playful and participatory strategies that we can gradually deconstruct the discourses of female responsibility and blame concerning reproductive processes or their interruption, ensuring the right to citizenship.\nPromoting interventions like these, aiming to transform the current logic, allows for constructing a path to women’s autonomy and equality, who have been silenced for much of history. Thus, reflecting on and understanding these issues help women to understand their rights and claim them.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "11.1 Introduction\nThis text reports on a consultancy carried out through interventions focused on gender literacy in schools. This consultancy was conducted in response to the growing need to address the deep gender inequalities present in society, particularly in the educational context.\nThe demand for interventions related to gender literacy becomes evident in light of issues highlighted by recent studies, which emphasize the importance of addressing gender disparities to combat violence against women (Araújo, 2008) and the negative impacts of sexism on men’s behaviors and emotional skills (Zaiba & Sinha, 2023). This demand aligns with the guidelines of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on education for gender equality and women’s empowerment, which reinforce the relevance of contextualized educational interventions to promote a more equitable society (UNESCO, 2017).\nAiming to promote gender literacy in schools, the intervention was based on a multifaceted understanding of the concept of gender, which goes beyond the traditional binary. Thus, it explored aspects such as the relationship between gender and sex stereotypes, sexual orientation, and cultural influence in shaping the behavioral repertoire of men and women (Butler, 2012; Marques, 2021; Skinner, 2003; Zanello, 2018).\nIn this regard, gender is considered a social construct that perpetuates privileged pathways of subjectivation in Western society (Marques, 2021). Thus, patriarchy emerges as an ideology that sustains the power difference between men and women (Lerner, 2019; Saffioti, 2015). Gender inequalities manifest in various spheres, from everyday situations of violence to disparities in the labor market (Guerin & Ortolan, 2017).\nUnderstanding the cultural patterns that perpetuate gender inequalities is fundamental for directing effective educational interventions, among which gender technologies stand out: mechanisms that drive the learning of behaviors supposedly intended for men and women, such as movies, soap operas, games, among others. These technologies culturally shape the being of men and women and directly impact the formation of gender stereotypes, contributing to the unequal power relationship between men and women that perpetuates across various spheres of society (Lauretis, 1994).\nTo reduce these inequalities, one strategy is to introduce gender discussions in the school context, as the school, as a social apparatus, plays a crucial role in reproducing or deconstructing these norms (Eugenio & Jardim, 2020; Jardim & Abramowicz, 2005). The school, by committing to promoting educational actions aimed at non-sexism, can significantly contribute to reflection and cultural change. This insertion, supported by the National Curriculum Parameters (PCNs), should be carried out in a dialogical and participatory manner, recognizing the school as a democratic space (Alves, 2018; Rena, 2006).\nAuthors exploring the relationship between gender and education emphasize that the school acts as an influential agent in forming individuals and reproducing inequalities. Markers such as the separation of boys and girls in school activities; the books available in the library, where romance and poetry are intended for girls and action and adventure for boys; the institution’s sports court, generally used by boys for sports practice; and the organization of the school’s physical spaces all contribute to unequal learning processes (Louro, 1997; Moreira et al., 2021).\nAmong the pedagogical initiatives to deconstruct gender norms, it is suggested to create discussion groups, include content on gender and sexuality in school curricula, and organize mixed activities. Also relevant is the training of teachers sensitive to gender issues (Soares, 2003). Regarding experiences of interventions that relate gender and education, activities with teachers and students aimed at changing perceptions about gender and reducing levels of prejudice can be mentioned (Alves, 2017; França & Calsa, 2012).\nThus, this consultancy aimed to promote gender literacy in middle school. It is expected to contribute to advancing gender equality in society.",

    "text": "11.1.1 Gender Literacy in Schools\nIn the realm of gender literacy, it is essential to consider the influence of social discourses that permeate the construction of gender identities. In this context, literacy practices play a crucial role in deconstructing stereotypes and promoting inclusive and equal education. Addressing gender in the school environment is not just about transmitting information but requires creating pedagogical strategies that stimulate critical reflection on the social constructions of gender (Louro, 2000).\nMoreover, it is necessary to address the multiple dimensions of identity, such as race and class, in constructing gender literacy practices in schools (Zanello, 2018). This construction, therefore, should not be dissociated from an intersectional vision, recognizing the different forms of oppression and discrimination present in society.\nIn this sense, some pedagogical initiatives can be implemented in schools to deconstruct gender and sexuality norms: forming discussion groups for sharing experiences among students; modifying school curricula and teacher training to promote sexual and gender education; debates on sexual diversity, conducting mixed activities, and including LGBTQIA+ characters in activities such as plays (Soares, 2003). Thus, the teacher plays a crucial role in creating an educational environment that promotes respect for gender diversity. Continuous training of educators, coupled with a reflective attitude, is essential for the successful incorporation of gender literacy in the school curriculum (Scott, 1995).\nIn summary, constructing gender literacy practices in schools demands a comprehensive and multidisciplinary theoretical approach. Integrating intersectional perspectives, participatory didactic strategies, and the educator’s role are key elements for developing an inclusive school environment aligned with gender equity principles.",

    "section": "11.2 The Intervention Conducted",
    "text": "11.2 The Intervention Conducted\n\n11.2.1 Initial Visit to the School, Proposal Dissemination, and Signing of Consent and Assent Forms\nThe intervention was carried out in a full-time public school in a city with approximately 20,000 inhabitants, located in the interior of Ceará state, between August and October 2022. After prior contact with the school’s management team, a visit was scheduled to formalize the partnership. During this visit, a brief explanation of the objectives and theme of the intervention, as well as the methodology to be used, was provided. The administrative director and the coordinator of the final years of middle school were present. Both were willing to collaborate and offered the video room and the Wednesday morning slot for the meetings.\nIt was agreed that the students would be taken out of class during the first two periods (07:00 – 08:40) and taken to the space designated for the intervention. This arrangement was discussed with the teachers who taught during this period, and they all agreed with the system. Concluding the visit, the date for the intervention’s dissemination to the students and the start date of the activities were set.\nThe following day, another visit to the school took place to disseminate the intervention among the students. On this day, the basic precepts of the intervention and the methodology of the meetings were presented to the students, and doubts about what was addressed were clarified. The students were also informed that the interventions would begin the following week and be held on Wednesdays.\nTo those interested in participating, an Assent Form was provided, given the students’ age group, and a Free and Informed Consent Form (TCLE), as the intervention was part of a broader study approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University Vale do Acaraú (CAEE 53379421.9.0000.5053). The guardians were informed about the procedures the students would undergo and could, at any time, question and clarify any doubts.\nIt was agreed with the management team and the students that if the guardians felt the need to clarify any doubts, they could go to the school, as the researcher would be there during the first morning period to receive them. No parent or guardian sought the school or the researcher.\n\n\n11.2.2 Participants\nTwenty-five students participated in the intervention, of which 13 were female and 12 male, from the final grades of middle school: 7th grade (4 participants), 8th grade (12 participants), and 9th grade (9 participants). The students were not divided by gender, age, or the grade they were in.\n\n\n11.2.3 The Intervention Process\nThe intervention was conducted on the school’s premises in a room reserved by the institution. The students always arranged the chairs in a circle. This was not a requirement of the researcher leading the intervention, but it was noticed that everyone felt welcomed this way, which motivated participation. While the students performed a given task, the researcher walked around the room and answered recurring questions about the task itself.\nThe group interventions were divided into five structured meetings following the proposal of França (2012), each addressing a theme related to gender: a) activating the participants’ prior knowledge about the themes; b) explaining and justifying the group’s understanding of the theme; c) problematizing this understanding; d) raising alternative concepts to those identified in the previous stages; e) provisional conclusions of each session. Each meeting lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\n11.2.3.1 Meeting 1: Getting to Know the Participants\nAll participants were present at the first meeting, dedicated to introducing the students. For this purpose, the “self-portrait” activity was carried out, aiming to bring\nthe group members closer together and strengthen the bonds between them and the researcher. Papers and colored pencils were distributed, asking each student to describe their characteristics. This activity promotes a moment of self-reflection on identity and allows for greater closeness with the “other.” Additionally, it involves feelings and creativity, enabling reflection on one’s identity (Maia et al., 2013).\nEach participant showed their work to the others, who observed and tried to describe what they saw in the image. The dynamic met its objective, as the students’ engagement showed they could get closer and know each other better.\nAfter this dynamic, information was conveyed, and participants’ doubts were clarified. The previously agreed terms were reiterated. Furthermore, it was emphasized that the researcher would be responsible for guiding the students, picking them up from their respective classrooms, and taking them to the meeting location. This practice was implemented to avoid dispersions on the school premises, thus ensuring the participants’ presence and involvement during the scheduled meetings.\n\n\n11.2.3.2 Meeting 2: Gender in Music\nThe second meeting had twenty-three students participating and aimed to introduce and familiarize the participants with the theme of gender. The approach began by questioning the students about the concept of gender, and from their answers, a brief explanation on the topic was given, including the definition of gender, its relevance to our construction as human beings, the difference between gender and sex, and the consequences and impacts that gender stereotypes have on life in society.\nContinuing, examples of cultural instruments that reinforce the previously discussed inequalities and consequences were presented. For this purpose, some musical compositions were used, along with the following question: how are gender stereotypes conveyed in the musical compositions we often listen to?\nThree Brazilian compositions of distinct styles were selected to illustrate this stage of the discussion: “Estranha Loucura,” interpreted by the renowned singer Alcione; “Vidinha de Balada,” performed by the duo Henrique and Juliano; and “Desconstruindo Amélia,” sung by Pitty. The choice of these songs was based solely on the criterion that they are Brazilian compositions, present diverse musical styles, and contain lyrics that provoke the central discussion of this investigation.\nThe first musical composition analyzed addresses the theme of male virility and female submission in romantic contexts. Titled “Estranha Loucura,” the song portrays the experience of a woman who perceives herself as “crazy” for being involved in a one-sided relationship, where her actions are disproportionately dedicated to maintaining the relationship while the partner remains passive. She bears the burden of responsibility for the relationship, taking the blame for any disagreements, while the partner is absolved of any responsibility. In this context, traditional femininity standards are represented by the expectation of unconditional understanding and kindness, while masculinity standards are defined by the dependence and humiliation imposed on the woman (Jesus, 2018).\nIn the second song, male virility is emphasized through sexual expression and the demonstration of strength, highlighting the narrative where the male subject coerces the female figure to love him at any cost. Furthermore, the song perpetuates the idea that the desirable woman for marriage is the one who avoids party environments, maintains a modest demeanor, and refrains from consuming alcoholic beverages. The song’s lyrics subtly disguise violence and normalize behaviors characteristic of abusive relationships, such as forced kisses, rule imposition, and emotional coercion, portraying these actions as romantic and socially acceptable.\nThe choice of the last musical composition was deliberate to introduce a contrasting perspective to the themes presented in the previous songs. The lyrics of this song explore the process of female emancipation, moving away from the traditional role of women confined to home and family. Instead, the narrative highlights a woman who works outside the home, takes care of herself, and allows herself moments of leisure and fun. This representation challenges the socially imposed roles on women, highlighting the existence of multifaceted female identities beyond historically established limitations (Jesus, 2018).\nThe students were divided into smaller teams, given printed lyrics of each song, and instructed to discuss the following topics:\n\nRepresentation of women in the songs;\nThree problematic behaviors of men mentioned in the lyrics;\nChanges in male behavior intended to avoid these problematic behaviors;\nChanges in female behavior perceived throughout the songs.\n\nThe purpose was to investigate the gender dynamics present in the lyrics and identify stereotypes, behavioral patterns, and possible narrative evolutions. The aim was to provide a critical analysis of the conveyed messages.\nAdditionally, during the activity, the implications of abusive behaviors motivated by gender in forming our individual identity and social dynamics were discussed. Data related to violence against women and its impacts on the process of constructing subjectivity for both men and women were presented to support these discussions. During this interaction, the students not only answered the proposed questions but also shared relevant examples, demonstrating engagement in the activity. It is important to note that at this moment, the groups were spontaneously formed, providing a more fluid and participatory dynamic.\nTo conclude, a brief summary of what had been discussed was given, and participants were asked what they had learned at that moment.\n\n\n11.2.3.3 Meeting 3: Gender Technologies\nThe third meeting had all participants present and began with a review of the concept of gender and key points discussed in the previous meeting. Next, to assess the participants’ prior knowledge, a series of images culturally associated with male and female gender stereotypes were presented. These images were selected to illustrate the ‘oppositions and inequalities’ between genders, exemplifying the devices of love/maternity and virility described by Zanello (2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Representation of alcoholic beverage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Representation of work with numbers (productive)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3: Representation of physical strength\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: Representation of power/leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Representation of political debate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Representation of marriage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Representation of aesthetic procedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Representation of romantic love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Representation of weight loss\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: Representation of silence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach image was presented individually, and the participants were asked to categorize them as ‘man,’ ‘woman,’ or ‘both.’ This activity aimed to examine the influence of gender roles on students’ perceptions. At the end, the images were organized into the corresponding groups, resulting in the following categorization:\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Division of images conducted by the students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWoman\nBoth\nMan\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of silence\nRepresentation of marriage\nRepresentation of physical strength\n\n\nRepresentation of work with numbers (productive)\nRepresentation of political debate\nRepresentation of power/leadership\n\n\nRepresentation of weight loss\nRepresentation of alcoholic beverage\n\n\n\nRepresentation of aesthetic procedure\n\n\n\n\nRepresentation of romantic love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, an explanation was provided to the group about why certain images are readily associated with women while others are attributed to men. This explanation aimed to contextualize the categorization and understanding the group developed about the theme, providing a deeper insight into these concepts in relation to reality. In this context, it was appropriate to introduce the concept of ‘gender technologies,’ highlighting how images, symbols, and other cultural productions are used in society to reinforce gender norms and expectations, thus influencing our perception and interpretation of the roles of men and women (Zanello, 2018).\nTo problematize the mentioned concept and illustrate how it manifests in practice, several magazine covers circulating in our country were presented. In the discussion, it was emphasized that the magazine covers featuring women were limited to presenting aspects related to beauty and fitness, conveying the understanding that the “beautiful” and valued woman is thin, white, and has straight hair. This emphasis on physical appearance reverberates in sexual objectification and, consequently, in the daily violence women face. Additionally, the discussion included the issues raised by the covers featuring men. It was noted that men are privileged because, according to what is portrayed on the covers, they are on the “side” where money and professional success reside. It was discussed that a socially valued man is one who financially supports his family and is a conqueror (Zanello, 2018).\nAfter this exploration, the problematization of the understanding the students had developed was conducted. To do this, the students were asked to identify three examples of gender technologies, which could include characters from movies, cartoons, series, soap operas, songs, magazine covers, games, toys, among others. Some responses emphasized the roles of protagonists in soap operas, portraying women in a vulnerable position, constantly seeking romantic love to live “happily ever after.” Other participants mentioned that the villains in children’s cartoons are always “witches,” pointing out that these “witches” became what they were because they were rejected by men for not having a beautiful or attractive appearance.\nTo conclude the discussion, the central concept addressed in the meeting was reviewed. There were also questions about the main points learned by the participants.\n\n\n11.2.3.4 Meeting 4: Reversing Roles\nThis meeting recorded the presence of sixteen participants and aimed to problematize socially prescribed and accepted behaviors for men and women. To assess the students’ prior knowledge, they were divided into groups separated by gender, with each group receiving a sheet of paper. They were asked to list ten behaviors (five feminine and five masculine) that are often considered appropriate for men and women in daily life. The lists produced by the groups were as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: List made by the girls’ group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: List made by the boys’ group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lists were read and discussed in a large group. To promote participants’ understanding and foster discussion, the concepts discussed in previous meetings, such as gender technologies, behavioral scripts, and gender, were used. These concepts aimed to promote a new understanding, allowing new perspectives on culturally taught behaviors.\nThe students were encouraged to challenge and question the social roles attributed to men and women. To facilitate this moment, they were invited to reverse roles and represent behaviors typically associated with the opposite sex. Again, the boys assumed behaviors generally attributed to girls, and vice versa.\nThus, the boys’ group represented a woman exercising her profession outside the home and having fun with her friends at a party. It is noteworthy that the mannerisms used by the students to portray a woman were still stereotypical, which was discussed in the group after the presentation. Next, the girls represented a man with violent and aggressive behaviors towards his wife and then an “alternative version,” showing a man who shares household chores\n, is present in child-rearing, and respects his wife’s wishes and rights.\nUsing these representations, we discussed gender stereotypes and pointed out more alternative behaviors and roles that men and women can perform. Here, the concept of gender stereotypes was reinforced (Zanello, 2018). The discussion included several examples, such as professions taboo for women (e.g., football player) and activities related to child care, easily imposed on women.\nTo conclude, the main points discussed in the meeting were reviewed.\n\n\n11.2.3.5 Meeting 5: Addressing Gender Inequality\nThe final meeting had the participation of twenty-one students and aimed to present the main consequences of gender inequality. Initially, participants were provided with news articles related to violence against women as a method to assess and expand their prior knowledge on the topic. The news was read, and the reason behind the presented data was discussed with the students. The issue of gender inequality and its consequences in economic, political, educational, social, and cultural spheres was emphasized, explaining that the absence of women in leadership positions and policy-making prevents improvements in these indices. Besides the data presented in the news, it was highlighted that women earn less than men, often performing the same function, and that unpaid work is mostly performed by women since men occupy leadership positions and engage in paid activities (Zanello, 2018).\nContinuing, four concrete situations illustrating gender inequality in practice were presented to the students. They were then asked to reflect on each situation and determine if they were true or false. It was previously confirmed that situations 1 and 3 were true, while situations 2 and 4 were false. It is important to note that these situations were selected from news websites to ensure a solid and updated basis for the ongoing discussion:\n\nOf the 22 federal deputies elected from our state last Sunday, only 3 are women;\nHigher-paid leadership and power positions are mostly occupied by women;\nWorldwide, there are more girls than boys out of school;\nMost men have a double work shift: they work outside the home and still handle household chores.\n\nMost students were unaware of the truth of statements 1 and 3 and considered them false. Upon discovering their accuracy, they were surprised by the portrayed inequality. Regarding the other situations, participants promptly responded that they were false, justifying that they had seen these statements in previous meetings. This stage served to problematize the concept of inequality and allowed students to think of alternative ways to minimize the political and educational inequality portrayed in the sentences.\nThus, the students were divided into three groups and instructed to think of alternative solutions to mitigate the presented challenges. The alternative solutions proposed by the students are listed below:\n\nReport cases of violence against women;\nEncourage men’s commitment to equally sharing household chores;\nTalk more about this topic at school for other students who did not participate in this project;\nElect more women in politics;\nElect people with gender-related agendas;\nAssume, as students, the duty to use our voice and knowledge to speak about these issues in various places;",

    "section": "11.3 Intervention Results",
    "text": "11.3 Intervention Results\nAt the end of each meeting, participants were asked, “What did you learn in this meeting?” Often, the students reported that those moments contributed to expanding their knowledge on the topic and possibly changing their behavior towards situations that provoke gender stereotypes. Some participants emphasized that they “never thought about” the addressed situations and would now start to police themselves to avoid reproducing such stereotypes and reinforcing gender inequalities.\nOne point that deserves attention is the maternal and amorous device. The maternal device is socially constructed and naturalizes discourses and practices that address motherhood and care as inherently and naturally feminine. The amorous device is defined as discourses and practices that conceive romantic love as a natural and essentially feminine experience. These devices are understood to reinforce and perpetuate gender inequality, as they can be considered a form of power that shapes women’s experiences (Zanello, 2018; Zanello & Porto, 2016).\nHistorically, the maternal device evolved from the 17th century when the understanding that motherhood was an extension of procreation emerged. Thus, with this understanding, the woman is seen as a “natural” caregiver, and motherhood is idealized as a leap in women’s quality of life (Zanello & Porto, 2016). The following statements illustrate this device:\n\nMy dad and I don’t help my mom at home. She does everything by herself. (Student 1)\n\n\nAt my house, it’s me and my brother. My mom only makes me do things and not my brother. (Student 1).\n\nRegarding the amorous device, Zanello (2018) exemplifies that these discourses and practices associating women with romantic love can be elucidated through the metaphor of the “shelf of love.” For the author, women are subjected to this shelf and are culturally taught that their bodies are the great symbolic and matrimonial capital. Thus, there is a need to be emotional, caring, friendly, and loving to “be chosen,” regardless of who chooses them. On this shelf, the ideal is to be young, white, thin, and blonde. Anything that deviates from the “rule” is at the end of the shelf. This makes women extremely vulnerable and subjects them to competition with others. Additionally, this form of love differs from what happens with men.\n\nA friend of mine fought at school because the boy she liked kissed another girl. Instead of talking to the boy, she went to fight with the girl. (Student 2).\n\n\nTo be loved, you have to be standard: thin, cute, straight hair. (Student 3).\n\nThe device of effectiveness (laborative and sexual) also deserves attention. The device of effectiveness is linked to the fact that being a man, culturally, means dominating sexual and labor areas. It means being the provider. In other words, masculinity is achieved by displaying strength and sexuality, driving competitiveness and productivity (Badinter, 1993). The appreciation of masculine character happens when a man can support his family and have sexual dominance over his partner(s) (Connell & Messerschmidt, 2013). Thus, denying characteristics socially associated with women is a way to sustain hegemonic masculinity (Baére & Zanello, 2018).\nThe social and economic changes in Brazil, mainly after abolition, relate to the historical scenario of the effectiveness device. At the time, there was a social ideal characterized by preserving privileges and hierarchies of wealthy, heterosexual white men, the family heads. With the advancement of urbanization, the value given to work and effort became a way to measure men’s masculinity, making sexual performance and productivity at work two important criteria for the idealization of “masculine personality,” reinforcing the hegemony and male domination in society (Zanello, 2018).\nAn indication of the effect of socialization and the culture in which participants are inserted, which can lead to the relentless pursuit of positions of power and professional success, with the constant need to prove masculinity in the work environment, bringing stress, exhaustion, and difficulty in seeking a healthy balance between work and personal life, can be seen in the following statements:\n\nMy mom’s husband keeps reminding her that the house is his, that he supports her, and that she must obey him for that reason. (Student 2)\n\n\nMy sister spent her entire pregnancy being beaten because the guy thought he should hit her just because she depended on him. (Student 3)\n\nIt is evident that the effectiveness device brings numerous benefits to men while also placing a burden on them, as it reinforces unattainable and limiting expectations. Additionally, it is important to emphasize that not all men fit these standards, such as gay and transgender individuals, and imposing this masculinity can create a violent and hostile environment for these individuals. Other consequences can be cited, such as stress, anxiety, and limitations in expressing emotions. It is crucial to question these expectations to allow a new experience of masculinity that permits men’s expression in an authentic and healthy manner (Queiroz, 2021). This limitation in expressing emotions was observed during the interventions, as the boys verbalized that “they couldn’t cry” because it would be a reason for mockery from their peers.",

    "text": "11.4 Final Considerations\nThis article aimed to report on gender literacy interventions conducted with adolescents, students in the 7th, 8th, and 9th grades of a full-time school located in the interior of Ceará State. Below is a self-assessment of the proposal based on the following attributes: impact; coverage; potential coverage; replicability; complexity; innovation.\nThe impact of the proposal is relevant, considering that the school can be a significant space used to inform about the topic and, consequently, to potentially reduce gender inequality levels that permeate various social layers. The consultancy’s utility lies in facilitating access to the theme, which is still socially disapproved. Similarly, the approach used during the intervention is relevant, facilitating learning and bringing students closer to the topic.\nThe consultancy will have local coverage. Potential coverage relates to the possibility of expanding and reapplying the proposal, which may be feasible, as it is believed that interventions can be conducted with other students, as well as teachers and staff at the school. Additionally, interventions can be conducted in other educational institutions, with updated content and methodologies.\nThe intervention can be reapplied, as no difficulties were detected in understanding the theme or the subthemes addressed, nor did it require significant physical infrastructure for the meetings. Furthermore, it is possible to consider that there was positive participation from the students, as they always performed the proposed activities and enhanced the discussions when requested.\nThe intervention can be considered of medium complexity, as it involved simple activities but required facilitator skills, such as theoretical and empirical knowledge on the topic and effective communication skills, among others.\nFinally, the use of active and participatory methodologies, as well as discussing situations and reflecting on potentially unequal gender actions, considering the context and experiences of the participants, provided interaction among the students and facilitated dialogue and knowledge exchange, also enabling behavior changes that can perpetuate gender inequalities, stereotypes, and biases.",

    "text": "12.2 Problem Analysis: What Led Us to the School?\nInitially, Dr. João Ribeiro Ramos High School established a partnership with the laboratory, positioning itself as a beneficiary of the extension activities offered by the program. Having presented the proposed activities usually conducted by LAEDDES, the management showed additional interest in understanding the meanings the student body attributed to the school, so that these could be presented to the faculty. Thus, the laboratory, beyond conducting its regular extension activities, developed specific research mechanisms for data collection and analysis in its interventions with the students of Dr. João Ribeiro Ramos High School, to support a well-founded presentation to the teachers and administrators of the institution.\nAware that students have diverse trajectories and that these entail various perspectives and meanings about education, and understanding that the meanings attributed directly affect the teaching-learning process, the extension activities of LAEDDES worked with the students, listening to them about the meanings they attribute to the school. These meanings, constructed by the students, referred to in the text presented to the teachers, are verbal forms about these attributions, minimally defining how students view the school environment and the relationships within it.\nThus, we initially assumed the existence of an interconnection between the themes of youth, modernity, and public school based on previously acquired experiences from listening to students by the project’s extensionists. Later, we became interested in knowing how and in what ways these existing relationships affect students in the school environment. Listening to and analyzing these data allowed us to conclude that within the school, there are diverse meanings about youth experiences, among which three themes stand out: future uncertainties, the challenges of existing demands, and affective relationships.\nTherefore, the importance of analyzing these meanings lies in the singularities and, at the same time, in the pluralities attributed by the students to their school experiences, allowing us to understand a bit of their lived experiences. Conveying these meanings to the teachers is essential, as they are also part of this interconnection and directly contribute to the construction of these meanings.",

    "text": "12.4 Development\n\n12.4.1 Methodology Details\nBefore going into the field, readings were conducted on the themes of education, public school, poverty, youth, and modernity, as well as the relationship between each of these themes.\nFollowing the acceptance of the interventions proposed by the laboratory, we worked with the management to create a visitation schedule for the selected classes, which were four third-year classes, totaling 73 participants. All activities were conducted in October 2019 and were led by psychology students from the Federal University of Ceará – Sobral Campus, members of LAEDDES, divided into groups of 8, each responsible for two classes.\nUpon entering the field, we conducted an initial intervention with each class by presenting the trailer of the 2017 documentary “Nunca Me Sonharam” and the song “Cota Não é Esmola” by singer and composer Bia Ferreira. After these presentations, we divided the class into groups of about 5 students and 2 extensionists to discuss their thoughts on the presented media and debate topics such as dreams, future, school, university, and quotas. These initial discussions were important for creating bonds with the students and facilitating communication for the next stages of the intervention.\nIn a second moment with each class, we presented slides about the public technical and higher education institutions available in the city of Sobral, as well as information on courses, entrance exams, and other important elements, aiming to present the university as a viable path for these young people. At the end of the presentations, the extensionists were available to answer students’ questions and, from there, discuss the issues that most concerned them.\nIn our final meeting, we applied the Instrument for Generating Affective Maps (IGMA) with each class. The IGMA is a tool developed by Bomfim (2003) in his doctoral thesis as a method for investigating emotions related to the environment. This tool is divided into two parts, with a qualitative component, through which the participant creates images and expresses their feelings in writing, and a quantitative component, which we did not use, consisting of a Likert-type scale.\nRegarding the application procedures, materials such as A4 sheets, colored pencils, pens, and pencils were initially made available to the students. We asked them to represent, through drawings, their way of seeing and feeling the school. Then, we asked them to list 6 words that expressed and summarized their feelings about this space. After this moment, we began a conversation about what they represented, using the following questions as prompts: What does your drawing mean? What feelings does it represent? What words did you write? Why? Finally, we asked the young people to write their age and sex on their sheet, identifying themselves by name only if they felt comfortable doing so. It is worth noting that for this application, we divided the class into small groups of students, with extensionists as mediators for each group to facilitate and bring the dialogue closer to all participants.\nFor data analysis2, we used the software IRAMUTEQ (Interface de R pour les Analyses Multidimensionnelles de Textes et des Questionnaires) and Bardin’s Content Analysis methodology (1977), along with theoretical support from Social Representation Theory (SRT).\nThe study of the content of\nrepresentations was carried out using the words produced by the students with the help of Similarity Analysis performed by IRAMUTEQ. Similarity Analysis allows identifying occurrences and indications of the connection between words, aiding in identifying the structure of the content of a textual corpus (Camargo & Justo, 2013). In this context, the words were categorized using Bardin’s Content Analysis process (1977), involving operational stages: organization, coding, and categorization of the material. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis and interpretation of thematic content grouped by categories, guided by Social Representation Theory, which allows us to understand how subjects construct and express their meanings to their experiences in the social world and project social values and aspirations (Jodelet, 2001).\nFinally, to achieve the advisory’s objective, the data were presented to the teachers, pedagogical coordination, and school administration through an oral presentation via Google Meet on May 20, 20213.\n\n\n12.4.2 Counterparts\nTo ensure the smooth conduct of the advisory process, the school and the laboratory established an agreement in which Dr. João Ribeiro Ramos High School would provide weekly spaces for the activities and be responsible for convening the entire teaching staff for the presentation of results. The school’s commitment was essential, as it made it possible to carry out the activities proposed by the extension. The Laboratory for the Study of Inequalities and Diversities – LAEDDES was responsible for applying the affective maps to collect the necessary data for the chosen analysis, conducting the data analysis, and cataloging them for subsequent presentation to the school’s teaching staff, pedagogical coordination, and administration. Recruitment, selection, and training of the individuals involved in the extension activities were also the responsibility of the Laboratory.\n\n\n12.4.3 Investment\nThe advisory required the involvement of 22 people: the laboratory coordinator, Francisca Denise Silva Vasconcelos, scholarship extensionists Barbara Ellen Viana Sales and Luana Paiva da Silva, and 19 volunteers. Thus, in addition to the costs of materials and transportation to the school, the operationalization of the advisory primarily required human resources. In this perspective, the support of the university, especially the Dean of Extension – PREX, in validating the coordinator’s work hours, funding the scholarships, and issuing certification for volunteer extensionists, was essential for the advisory’s success.",

    "text": "12.5 Results/Deliverables\nAfter fieldwork and data analysis, the results showed that the school represents a space of conflicting feelings; at times, it translates into a place of acceptance, and at other times, it becomes a place of psychological distress due to excessive demands placed on the students. Regarding positive associations, the school involves a set of affective relationships between friendship groups, helping students to view this space as a welcoming environment. However, the negative meanings relate to the high demands imposed by the institution, generating stressful feelings such as fear, insecurity, and anxiety.\nBased on these data, it was suggested to the institution to hold support groups with the school’s teachers, mediated by LAEDDES extensionists, to discuss themes affecting their professional and personal lives. This action aimed not only to open a space for dialogue and listening for these professionals but also to ensure that the issues raised by the students were debated with the teachers, given their close relationship with the students in the classroom.",

    "text": "12.6 Conclusion\nIn retrospect, it can be seen that the advisory achieved its proposed objective, contributing to improved dialogue between the school and high school students, promoting active listening by the teaching and administrative staff to students’ perceptions. The activities developed in this technical production offered the school’s teaching and administrative staff fundamental knowledge for adopting changes that favor relationships with students.\nConsidering that the results presented by the advisory touched on the impact of teaching methodologies and detailed student perceptions of acceptance and oppression in the school environment, it is reasonable to expect that they will help generate new teaching methodologies and strategies to address conflicts in teacher-student relationships. Thus, it is legitimate to assume that this advisory has potential implications for teaching-learning and reducing dropout rates.\nThe success of this advisory is closely linked to a strong extension activity at the university, specifically the ties that the Laboratory for the Study of Inequalities and Diversities establishes with the school community of Sobral and the region since its creation in 2011. Despite this, there is room for improvement. On the one hand, extension activities are still undervalued, including in terms of funding, compared to other areas like research, although, as seen in this chapter, both can go hand in hand, mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, good ties with the school community alone are not enough to eliminate concrete obstacles, such as the difficulty of finding time and space to carry out activities, given the excessive focus of schools on the National High School Exam (ENEM) and the school calendar, which needs to be well-adjusted to the demands of the Department of Education (SEDUC).\nFinally, this advisory also demonstrates the significant role that art, through the application of Affective Maps, can play in improving education. In this methodology, students were invited to use art (drawing, poetry, among others) to express their feelings about the school. Art, therefore, can be a powerful tool in addressing the long-standing issue of the teacher-student relationship, bringing to the center of the debate a new way of listening to high school students. While talking about or giving a lecture on feelings of anguish, fear, and anger may not be very productive, using music, poetry, and the arts in general for students to express these feelings opens a communication channel, as these students’ emotions become accessible to themselves and others. As explained throughout this chapter, accessing, analyzing, and reflecting on student perceptions and feelings is a way to help school management and teaching staff think about strategies for change.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "13.1 Introduction\nWith the implementation of the Unified Health System (SUS) in 1990, a nationwide and public system was initiated, based on principles and guidelines common to the entire Brazilian territory, as stipulated in its Organic Law (Laws No. 8,080/90 and No. 8,142/90). This system is oriented not only towards SUS assistance and management but also towards training for the health field. This aspect is seldom discussed, especially in the realm of Psychology. However, to respond to the numerous changes in services and health care and management practices brought about by SUS, significant changes in the training process and the development of professionals to work in this area were and still are necessary (Cavalheiro & Guimarães, 2011).\nSince 1986, when the First National Conference on Human Resources in Health was held, the training of professionals for SUS has been among the discussed topics, revealing the need to create programs aimed at this aspect (Silva & Santana, 2015). To systematize and implement a specific policy for the issue of human resources aimed at SUS, the Ministry of Health established the Department of Health Management and Education (DEGES) within the Secretariat of Labor and Education Management in Health (SGTES). This department proposed the creation of a national policy for the training and development of health professionals. Programs such as continuous education centers, AprenderSUS, VerSUS, the Health Work Education Program (PET-Saúde), and Multiprofessional Residencies were developed for this purpose. However, despite the numerous advances these programs represent for training linked to SUS, their implementation and operation present various challenges, such as:\nAdditionally, as pointed out by Almeida Filho (2013), we cannot ignore that the crisis in SUS is multifaceted, composed of factors linked to underfunding and an emphasis on bureaucratic management, which lacks the capacity to adopt conceptions aimed at practices based on integrality and equity in its actions. Furthermore, there are distortions in the training models of health professions, among which we can list: the construction of closed curricula with little interdisciplinary and interprofessional foundation, promoting an emphasis on specialties in isolation and maintaining the process of alienation of professional segments in this field, making it difficult to carry out work in multi- and interprofessional teams in services.\nThus, the training process for the health field ends up, even during undergraduate studies, constituting a kind of “premature specialization,” marked by few general studies that promote a broad vision of what constitutes the health knowledge field, the health-disease process, and care based on the critical framework of population needs and the social determinants of health (Almeida Filho, 2013). Such statements can be demonstrated by studies highlighting the emphasis given during health training to theoretical and practical content that focuses on segmented aspects of the individual, directed towards biophysiological characteristics, disregarding the need for graduates to understand the health-disease process integrated with the social, historical, and political characteristics of the population (Damiance & al., 2016).\nDiscussing the realm of educational policies, Carvalho and Ceccim (2009) problematize health graduations, stating that they are not directed towards the theoretical-conceptual and methodological training that promotes the construction of competencies focused on the integrality of their actions in SUS. On the contrary, health training processes still accumulate a content-based tradition, based on an excess of workload and composed of technical disciplines, disconnected from proposals that include articulations with research and extension, predominating an encyclopedic format oriented towards disease, seeking means of intervention for user rehabilitation/cure.\nPsychology has emerged as an important profession in the health field, with a significant expansion of its insertion and performance at various levels and services in SUS. However, according to Carvalho, Bosi, and Freire (2009), when challenged to enter the field of Collective Health, Psychology professionals face a complex context, where dynamics and historicity are expressed through the prevailing care model. This model is marked by political issues and professional cultures that cause discrepancies with the principles and parameters that encompass SUS. The authors reiterate that upon entering the health field, psychologists end up resorting to knowledge based on traditional clinical practice, not making the necessary revisions and contextualizations to guide their professional knowledge and practice in SUS.\nDimenstein (2001) supports this debate by pointing out that even though the more massive entry of psychologists into public health institutions has expanded the places of professional performance, this scenario has not promoted significant changes concerning the conceptual-epistemological and methodological foundations that underpin the actions developed in these spaces. Therefore, no significant updates have been made to contextualize these markers to promote reinventions in the traditional conceptual parameters of the profession, which are oriented towards the privatist clinical-hospital realm. Although there have been advances in this regard, as pointed out in more recent studies (Dimenstein & Macedo, 2012), these aspects have not yet become hegemonic in the profession, configuring a new professional reality for psychologists working in SUS.\nBased on these problematizations and the need for studies that deepen the epistemological, methodological, and ethical-political foundations of Psychology in SUS, we aim to analyze how Health and, more specifically, the debate around Collective Health have been integrated into Psychology training in Brazil, following the establishment of Resolution No. 8, of May 7, 2004, which institutes the National Curriculum Guidelines (DCN) for undergraduate Psychology courses and affirms it as a health profession (Conselho Nacional de Educação, 2004).",

The data source was the Ministry of Education’s database on Higher Education in Brazil, which indicated, in the 2019 Census, the existence of 929 Psychology courses, 829 of which were in private institutions and 100 in public institutions. Once each course was nominally located, a search for the Pedagogical Projects of Psychology Courses (PPC), available in the public domain, was conducted on the website of each Higher Education Institution (IES).\nAfter locating the respective curricula, a filter was applied to the set of disciplines, syllabi, and bibliographic references to locate curricular components related to Health/Collective Health. The search for such information considered the following descriptors: “collective health”, “health management”, “health planning”, “health education”, “permanent health education”, “epidemiology”, “integrality”, “multidisciplinary”, “multiprofessional”, “interdisciplinary”, “SUS”, “territory”, “care”, “health practices”, “citizenship”, “rights/human rights”, “public policies”, “health policies”, “social policies”, and “mental health”. All information was organized into a database containing the identification of the IES and the located curricular components.\nThe analysis was aided by the IRAMUTEQ software, which, integrated with the R software through the Python programming language, enables the performance of statistical analyses on textual corpora as well as tables consisting of words. This software allows for different types of textual data analyses, from the simplest, encompassing word frequency calculation, to the most complex, characterized as multivariate analyses (Camargo & Justo, 2013). In this aspect, we opted for the analysis using the Descending Hierarchical Classification (CHD) Method, which classifies text segments based on their respective vocabularies, aiming to construct classes that can present both similar and different vocabulary among themselves. Additionally, all analyses performed in IRAMUTEQ were interpreted in light of the epistemological, methodological, and ethical-political foundations of Collective Health. Finally, for ethical reasons, even though the documents are available in the public domain, we considered the anonymity of the courses in presenting the information.",

    "text": "13.3 Results\nThe search for the Pedagogical Projects of Psychology Courses available in the public domain on the website of each of the 929 IES returned 64 Course Projects. However, after applying the descriptors related to Health/Collective Health mentioned earlier, 30 curricula were selected, presenting curricular components related to the investigated theme, constituting the research corpus.\nTo provide a more general characterization of the analyzed material, we organized the Course Projects into the following categories: 12 courses in public IES and 18 in private IES, with 3 located in the North region, 12 in the Northeast, 3 in the Midwest, 6 in the Southeast, and 6 in the South. Regarding the size of the municipality where the courses are located: 10\nare in large cities, 2 in medium-large cities, 8 in medium-sized cities, 6 in medium-small cities, and 4 in small cities.\nNext, we examined each of the 30 curricula and found at least 727 disciplines, consequently 727 syllabi, as well as 428 bibliographic references related to any of the Collective Health descriptors that guided our search. Subsequently, these components were separately analyzed in specific textual corpora using the Descending Hierarchical Classification (CHD) Method, meeting the minimum criterion of 75% corpus utilization indicated by the literature (Camargo & Justo, 2013).\nFigure 1 presents the first analysis performed using the names of the identified PPC disciplines. Sequential divisions were made in the corpus until 7 classes were formed. The first division created three subcorpora. The first subcorpus, “Performance and Organization in Services,” consists of classes 6 and 1 and represents the second-largest percentage of text segments from the disciplines (29.2%). The words characterizing this subcorpus were: “ethics,” “profession,” “professional,” “management,” “intervention,” among others. The second subcorpus split into two: “School and Educational Psychology,” encompassing class 5, and “Collective Health,” comprising class 4. Class 5, “School and Educational Psychology,” corresponds to 16.4% of the text segments, consisting of words such as “educational,” “clinic,” “psychopathology,” and “institution.” Class 4, “Collective Health,” represents 16.4% of the text segments, characterized by words such as “interdisciplinary,” “collective,” and “promotion.” The third subcorpus, “Public Health,” includes classes 2, 3, and 7. Combined, these classes represent the largest percentage of text segments from the disciplines (41.9%). The words representing this subcorpus were: “right,” “environment,” “applied,” “evaluation,” “public,” among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: Dendrogram of Classes for the corpus of discipline names\n\n\n\nRegarding the analysis of the syllabi, the result is depicted in Figure 2, where sequential divisions were made in the corpus until 4 classes were formed. The first division created two subcorpora. The first subcorpus gave rise to class 4 – “Biomedical Model” – while the second subdivided into three, forming classes 1 and 2 – “Public Health” – and 3 – “Collective Health.”\nClasses 2 and 1, “Public Health,” correspond to 15.26% and 26.39% of the text segments, respectively. These are the most significant classes compared to the others, consisting of words related to the Public Health field: “right,” “public,” “behavior,” “legal,” “civil,” “assistance,” among others. Class 3, “Collective Health,” represents 33.3% of the text segments. This class refers to content encompassing the field of Collective Health and SUS, comprising words such as “health,” “care,” “SUS,” “collective,” “social,” “reform,” among others. Class 4, “Biomedical Model,” represents 24.6% of the text segments, referencing content from psychopathology and diagnostic psychiatric manuals, consisting of words such as “clinical,” “case,” “diagnosis,” “evaluation,” “psychopathological,” “disorder,” among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: Dendrogram of classes for the corpus of syllabi\n\n\n\nRegarding the analysis of references, the result is presented in Figure 3. Sequential divisions in the corpus of references resulted in 4 classes. The first division generated two subcorpora. The first split into classes 2 and 3; the second included classes 1 and 4.\nClasses 2 and 3, “Collective Health,” represent 28.4% and 28.1% of the text segments, respectively, and together account for the largest percentage (56.5%). These classes consist of elements related to the Psychiatric Reform movement and the Collective Health field, highlighting words such as “health,” “collective,” “care,” “reform,” “culture,” “subjectivation,” among others.\nClass 1, “Biomedical Model,” corresponds to 26.7% of the text segments, consisting of words such as “disorder,” “semiology,” “psychopathology,” “diagnosis,” “disturbance,” “treatment,” among others. Class 4, “Organizational and Work Psychology,” represents 16.9% of the segments, comprising terms such as “work,” “organization,” “resource,” “administration,” “management,” “capital,” among others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: Dendrogram of classes for the corpus of references\n\n\n\nAfter organizing the results by analyzed curricular component (discipline names, syllabi, and references), we present the categories that guided the data discussion:\n\nBiomedical Model;\nPublic Health Model; and\nCollective Health Model.

    "section": "13.4 Discussion",
    "text": "13.4 Discussion\n\n13.4.1 Biomedical Model\nThe analytical category we termed the “Biomedical Model” was related to words referring to the Psychiatric and Psychopathological field: “psychopathological,” “disorder,” “syndrome,” “diagnosis,” “disturbance,” among others. Of the total syllabi (n = 727) and bibliographic references (n = 428) in the 30 analyzed curricula, at least 24.96% (n = 181) of the syllabi and 26.7% of the reference titles (n = 113) were related to the “Biomedical Model.”\nIn terms of health conceptions guiding the training process in Psychology based on the Biomedical Model, Sobrosa et al. (2014) problematize that this model has its origins dated to the early 20th century, characterized by the understanding of health as the absence of diseases, emphasizing biological aspects accompanied by physiological alterations resulting from biochemical imbalances, lesions, and/or infections:\n\n“Main schools of psychopathology. Diagnosis in psychopathology. Classical psychiatry. Psychoanalysis and current diagnostic manuals, namely ICD 10 and DSM V. Meaning and evolution of concepts of normality and pathology” (PPC 13).\n\nExcept for the reference to Psychoanalysis and the indication of understanding the differentiation of its clinical structures in a few analyzed syllabi, overall, we observed the absence of more critical discussions about the syllabi gathered here to problematize the hegemonic paradigm in health under the ideal of cure and question the notions of normal and pathological, allowing little (if any) broader understanding of the health-disease-care processes. By emphasizing health training concepts with epistemological bases grounded in this model, Psychology ends up focusing on segmented aspects of the individual, primarily directed towards describing characteristics or psychological phenomena stemming from biophysiological or personality alterations, which will support theoretical-methodological markers centered on clinical-therapeutic approaches (Bernardes & Guareschi, 2010).\nIn this training model, the definition of health falls into naturalistic views, bringing only a predicted and ideal development of humans. As such, there is no relation to living conditions and society or the SUS principles in which it is immersed. Instead, it locates the causal factors of illness within the individual, promoting a notion that health depends solely on an effort to recover a lost previous state or prevent a future health problem from establishing itself (Camargo Jr, 2013).\nRegarding the practices addressed that encompass the biomedical category, these have a curative bias, focusing on symptom remission, primarily directed towards the traditional clinical and hospital realm:\n\n“Initial interview, anamnesis, and feedback. Clinical diagnosis and intervention. Mental examination and the issue of diagnosis. Identification of different symptoms in mental functions and clinical disorders” (PPC 10).\n\nThus, the relationship between Psychology and Health in the training processes here acquires characteristics close to what Oliveira, Balard, and Cutol (2013) call the “Flexnerian Model.” This model is based on anatomical-physiological aspects, directing actions towards the etiological agent and professional postures, which barely consider social and historical aspects. By approaching this model, Psychology training relies on the same reading keys to understand the psychological phenomenon, focusing on studying personality (in terms of structural and functional structures).\nIn these terms, Cintra and Bernardo (2017) argue that it is necessary to renew the set of practices presented and discussed during Psychology training, not to deny the said model, but to create a constant process of questioning the biomedical paradigm and foster students’ and teachers’ creativity in developing new intervention strategies. Thus, training would be synonymous with exercising creative autonomy to produce both theoretical and practical singularities, thereby broadening conceptions about the health-disease/suffering-care process.\nRegarding the ethical-political guidelines encompassing the biomedical category, these concepts were limited to the professional code of ethics, covering issues of professional confidentiality and the production of reports and opinions:\n\n“Main foundations of the professional code of ethics for psychologists. Structure and administration of the Professional Psychology Council and current legislation. Ethics in professional practice. Professional confidentiality” (PPC 7).\n\nThere is a notable emphasis on training in ethical-political aspects limited to professionally normative postures deemed appropriate and consistent with the professional code of ethics in Psychology. This scenario supports Dimenstein’s problematizations (2001), asserting that the dominant perspective of psychologists’ performance in the health field remains distant from social and political commitments in the profession, based on the concrete needs of the territory.\n\n\n13.4.2 Public Health Model\nThe analytical category we termed the “Public Health Model” was related to 41.9% (n = 305) of the text segments related to discipline names and syllabi. According to Souza (2014), this model refers to a part of Medicine that proposes to intervene in public administration to keep the population healthy, based on a set of norms and rules that individuals and their families must follow. Thus, health has a conception based on the administration of programs, services, and actions that regulate the behavior of individuals and specific population groups to reduce risk factors that compromise health and promote and establish healthy habits and lifestyles:\n\n“Introductory approach to Public Health. Sources of morbidity and mortality data. Population dynamics. Vital statistics and health indicators. Incidence and prevalence” (PPC 5).\n\nStarting from this, by emphasizing theoretical-practical frameworks based on the Public Health model during health training, Psychology ends up focusing solely on expanding its scope of action in this area. Its practice relies on the normativity of actions developed from a bureaucratic and informative bias. Thus, it focuses on the development and applicability of instruments that encompass a larger number of people but still remain centered on the etiological agent of an individual and privatist order, even when adopting prevention and health promotion biases (Souza, 2014).\nRegarding the practices addressed during the training process that encompass the Public Health model, these focus on expanding the hegemonic clinical model to the social realm to cover a larger number of people, based on health practices from a multidisciplinary perspective:\n\n“Diagnosis and intervention in Public Health. Planning, execution, and evaluation of interventions characteristic of the psychologist’s professional practice in Public Health” (PPC 28).\n\nBy focusing on presenting instruments during Psychology training that prioritize isolated actions based on traditional and descriptive epidemiology, this process is restricted to theoretical-methodological frameworks limited to working methods characteristic of Public Health. Consequently, Psychology training centralizes its actions on the biological conception of health through the development and participation in specific health campaigns, disjointed from other sectors (Education, Social Assistance, Security, among others) (Souza, 2014).\nRegarding the ethical-political guidelines of the curricula encompassing the Public Health category, these concepts were limited to normative discussions through booklets, statutes, and codes that encompass the field of civil rights and duties:\n\n“1988 Constitution. Statute of Children and Adolescents. Rights policies for children, adolescents, and the elderly. Possibilities of professional practice in rights policies” (PPC 3).\n\nGiven this perspective marked by the emphasis on an illusory professional neutrality regarding political and social causes, binary constructs are created in the Psychology training process, separating subject and object, interior and exterior, individual and collective, clinic and politics, clinic and collective health, and ultimately, Psychology and Politics. These divisions promote conceptual notions expressing these categories as dialectically opposed, distant, and naturally different, aiming to confer a degree of scientific validity to Psychology (Bernardes & Guareschi, 2010).\n\n\n13.4.3 Collective Health Model\nThis category had the following representation in the curricular components of the 30 investigated Course Projects: on the one hand, of the total 727 analyzed disciplines, we identified only 16.4% (n = 117) of the text components; on the other hand, of the total 727 syllabi, we identified 33.33% (n = 241); and of the total 428 references, we identified 56.5% (n = 243) of the text components related to the titles of works as belonging to the Collective Health field.\nScarcelli and Junqueira (2011) state that the Collective Health field seeks conceptions about the health-disease-care process that go beyond the boundaries of the biomedical model, marked by the emphasis on disease. Therefore, they understand this process as the result of a set of physical, psychological, and socioeconomic factors to which individuals are subjected:\n\n“Health management in Brazil. SUS and the Family Health Program. Integral care in Collective Health. Professional performance in public health policies” (PPC 1).\n\nFor Paim and Almeida Filho (1998), the importance of this broad understanding of the health concept encompassing the Collective Health field is to recognize that there is more than one truth, and these assume different positions depending on the social needs of the territory, i.e., the aspects related to the social determinants of health. Therefore, building health training in Psychology from intersections with the Collective Health model promotes the adoption of pedagogical strategies that go beyond the traditional teaching-learning model. Consequently, there are no considered correct ways of doing or ideal training models, but processes marked by conceptual and practical guidelines created and recreated based on the needs of each local reality in which these courses are embedded (Scarcelli & Junqueira, 2011).\nRegarding the practices addressed in the analyzed curricula that encompass the Collective Health model, these focus on the social health needs, using material and immaterial technologies and actions centered on different social groups and territories (Paim & Almeida Filho, 1998):\n\n“Primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention issues. Familiarization, Territorialization. Demand Survey and Intervention Planning. Identification and Prioritization of Needs and Resources” (PPC 7).\n\nThese results support Paim and Almeida Filho’s assertion (1998) that the “tools” of the professional in Collective Health are produced from the organicity of actions and socially constructed. Thus, according to the authors, these actions promote a dual role for the professional: that of a technician of health needs and in the management of health work processes, including clinical practice management, or even the management of services and work through sectoral health networks and intersectoral public policies present in the territory.\nRegarding the ethical-political guidelines addressed in the curricula encompassing the Collective Health category, these, in addition to covering technical, economic, and ideological aspects, involve a profession project linked to the emancipation of human beings through a set of concepts and practices focused on social needs:\n\n“Possibilities of professional practice in rights policies. Psychology and the field of rights. Psychology and social commitment. Culture. Politics. Society. Ideology. Democracy. Power. Social movements and citizenship” (PPC 28).\n\nBirman (1991) highlights this ethical-political dimension by pointing out that the naturalistic medical discourse has always marginalized the political dimension of health care. Thus, Collective Health would be one of the alternatives for restructuring the health field and Psychology itself concerning this field, by emphasizing ethical, political, and symbolic dimensions in its theoretical-conceptual guidelines, while relativizing the hegemony of the anatomical-physiological discourse without disregarding its importance in professional training.",

    "text": "13.5 Final Considerations\nIn general terms, when analyzing how Health and the Collective Health field constitute Psychology training based on the investigated courses, we observe advances, especially in the curricular scope. In this sense, we can highlight the emphasis given in syllabi, especially regarding bibliographic references, to theoretical-methodological and ethical-political guidelines related to the Collective Health model, which are quite pertinent and aligned with the current debate. However, the traditional Public Health field and the Biomedical model still strongly underpin the training processes with concepts, models, and practical guidelines for health work.\nTherefore, it is necessary to break with curricular proposals that reaffirm vertical architectures, that is, defined a priori solely by administrative and technical instances without considering local realities. It is urgent to articulate practice scenarios where courses are in harmony with services and the dynamics of the general population, including strengthening interdisciplinary and interprofessional training, as well as competencies focused on managing work processes of teams and between services if we want to advance with more well-qualified training to work based on SUS (Batista & Gonçalves, 2011).\nFinally, we understand that the theoretical-epistemological, technical-operative, and ethical-political foundations of the broad health discussions under the perspective of the Brazilian Health Movement and Collective Health need to be expanded and strengthened in the training processes of undergraduate Psychology courses, including emphasizing interprofessional training, so that our science and profession can advance in this field as a potent and articulated knowledge core with others, capable of offering more resolute, integral, and continuous care actions, full of innovations and transversalities that increase the resistance to continue supporting the Unified Health System, even amid the privatist logic that falls on Brazilian Public Health.",

    "text": "14.2 Extension Course “Racism, Mental Health, and Care Practices”\nThis course aimed to discuss the effects of racism on the mental health of black people and the challenges of caring for this population in the field of Psychosocial Care. This initiative was designed considering the issue of structural racism, which is expressed in social, political, legal, and economic relations, being one of the main triggers of psychological suffering for black populations in Brazil (Almeida, 2018).\nHistorically, in Brazil, the black population has been relegated to the margins of society, experiencing different forms of oppression and social exclusion (Damasceno & Zanello, 2018; Heringer, 2002; Igreja, 2016). Regarding Brazilian racial studies, Nogueira (2006) points to a tendency to deny racial prejudice, a kind of erasure of racist situations and softening of tensions that involve the maintenance of white privilege, which characterizes the Brazilian myth of racial democracy (A. Nascimento, 2017).\nThus, it is inferred that the social, economic, and political relations that sustain structural racism tend to be mitigated, so the sufferings resulting from situations of oppression can be summarized in the individual scope. Research indicates the need to discuss the effects of racism on the mental health of black populations (Cuevas et al., 2013; Faro & Pereira, 2011; Jones & Neblett, 2016; Pieterse et al., 2012). This is because, structurally, racism has driven an unequal distribution of resources and worse access to education, health, housing, justice, and work.\nAdditionally, some issues deserve more attention, such as: 1) the association between perceived racism/discrimination and some mental disorders (Tavares, 2018); 2) the greater vulnerability of the black population to mental disorders and the difficulty of self-care in this population in the face of daily violence. In terms of public policies in Brazil, ethnic-racial issues have already been addressed, especially within the SUS, with the National Policy for the Comprehensive Health of the Black Population. However, despite some advances, challenges in implementing this policy are recognized, as well as the need to intensify debates and achievements around racial issues and their impacts.\nThe course was conducted as an offshoot of research and extension activities developed by VIESES-UFC, which, as an Extension Program, has promoted medium and long-term actions that articulate research, extension, and teaching around the psychosocial aspects involved and resulting from the various expressions of violence and social exclusion, primarily aiming at producing intersections between the university and other social agents.\nThe course audience consisted of workers from the Psychosocial Care Network of Fortaleza, Psychology students and/or other areas, and other community members interested in the topic. The proposal was structured through modules, totaling 44 hours/class, during which we emphasized topics concerning the historical and conceptual aspects of racism studies and their impacts:\n\nmodule I: Racism: historical and conceptual aspects from an anticolonial perspective in dialogues with Social Psychology (8 hours);\nmodule II: Racism and intersectionality (8 hours);\nmodule III: Racism and mental health (8 hours);\nmodule IV: Care practices in the face of the effects of racism on mental health (8 hours);\nmodule V: Care practices in the face of the effects of racism on mental health (8 hours).\n\nForty-five people participated in the course.\nWe consider it important to address racism also from an intersectional perspective since race oppression intersects with class, gender, and territory. Therefore, we used participatory methodological approaches that fostered the exchange of experiences among participants about racial issues and the formation of a potent group where care and resistance practices in the face of daily expressions of racism were experienced, based on critical-reflective perspectives, from the experiences in the territories.\nThe five modules of the course were guided by the relationship: classes-practice scenarios, problematizing lived realities, based at the same time on legal, conceptual, methodological, and practical guidelines. Documents, texts, research, and national policies were used, establishing multiple dialogues with various disciplines, besides developing antiracist care practices in the field of Psychosocial Care.",

    "text": "14.3 Extension Course “Psychology and Human Rights: Experiences, Dialogues, and (De)constructions”\nThe course took place from March 23 to April 14, 2021, and aimed to critically address topics related to Psychology and Human Rights, based on professional experience reports, research results, and theoretical reflections. This initiative was designed considering the intersections between defending Human Rights and producing knowledge and interventions in Psychology, being relevant for professional and academic performance in its most diverse fields (Bicalho et al., 2009; Bock & Gianfaldoni, 2010; Coimbra, 2001; Scisleski & Guareschi, 2015). The field of Human Rights has been a territory of intense dispute by reactionary forces, aiming to exclude different existences from the condition of subjects to whom fundamental rights must be guaranteed (Barros et al., 2019). Therefore, it is of extreme relevance that the public university, especially Psychology courses, critically, plurally, and rigorously addresses such topics to denaturalize the psychosocial aspects that have historically corroborated the production of “unimportant,” “killable,” and “dying” subjects (Barros, 2019), as well as necropolitical expressions (Barros et al., 2019; Mbembe, 2017) that produce zones of death and modes of subjectivation indifferent to the extermination of these subjects.\nThe construction of the field of Human Rights is vast and complex, born from a universalist perspective of humanity, which places the essence of man at the center, the result of an aristocratic bourgeoisie (M. L. Nascimento & Coimbra, 2015), being necessary to think about this theme from a critical-reflective position. It is necessary to historicize this field, the result of a supposed evolution in search of the progress of the human genre (Hunt, 2009), so that there is no hegemonic naturalization of Human Rights, as it is a product of social practices, often transformed into a field of action of “specialisms.” This form of social control and framing of humanity is permeated by European colonialism, which historically updates and structures the modern/colonial world system (Lugones, 2014). Thus, a transdisciplinary and decolonial approach is fundamental to broaden the scope of this theme, understanding it as relevant to the current context of challenges in defending Brazilian democracy and confronting the growing violence and social and racial inequalities, to which gender is added.\nColonialism is an economic and political phenomenon that is at the origins of the structuring of sciences and is epistemologically linked to the birth of human sciences, where various oppressions of gender, ethnicity, and race are at play, as well as the identities of colonizers and colonized created in its eurocentrically established structuring (Ballestrin, 2013). Overcoming colonialism, colonialism, and coloniality relations was on the course’s agenda, considering the knowledge brought by Fanon and Césaire, among other authors, who deconstruct the “production of knowledge in the exercise of domination over the other” (Ballestrin, 2013, p. 93). Likewise, it is necessary to think about the notion of subalternity, according to (Figueiredo, 2010), concerning people and groups considered subaltern because they are outside the power of the hegemonic structure in theoretical critical Asian and Latin American studies, which, with Spivak (2020), point out an intellectual production crossed by imperialism and international economic interests, making it essential to exercise decolonizing Psychology and the traditional understanding of Human Rights. Both are founded under the power of the European elite that produces capitalist subjectivities (Guattari & Rolnik, 1996), as well as the understanding of a Western, globalized, neoliberal, and individualistic culture of society, permeated by the unequal production of existences and epistemicides (Santos, 1997). This complex framework was a reference for proposing the course in a critical understanding of knowledge for the decolonization of Psychology.\nTo move against uncritical and reductionist approaches to the subject, the course had as theoretical references the main thinkers of Psychology and related areas who problematize the “cis-hetero-patriarchal-colonial” patterns, structural racism, social and racial inequalities, as well as gender, and the psychosocial aspects of violence. The context of inequality, increasing urban violence, mass incarceration, violence against the LGBTQIA+ population (Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transvestites/Transsexuals, Queer, Intersex, Agender), black genocide, and inequality in relation to traditional peoples and other vulnerable groups needs to be understood in the very production of subjectivity, impacting the ways of life of subjects who, although they suffer its occurrence, are also active in overcoming the inequities experienced, producing resistance. Therefore, the course aimed to reflect on this context and understand the dynamics of violence that traverse the trajectory of children, adolescents, young people, women, blacks and blacks, who move between markers of race, class, and gender, seeking to produce ways of working that respect, stimulate, and help in the production of resistances.\nThe course took place in a virtual format, with a total of 36 hours, in twelve conversation circles, with the participation of guests, under the mediation of VIESES members. With 450 registered on the first day, the meetings took place three times a week, mediated by VIESES participants, and were broadcast synchronously on the Pós-PsicologiaS UFC YouTube channel, enabling the participation and certification of other interested people. This broadcast allowed later access to the Circles, enabling greater participation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first meeting reaching 1,754 views, and the other circles ranging between 500 and 1400 views by the end of the course. During the circle’s broadcast, those watching could participate through the chat, with an attendance list available.\nThe first Circle – “Racism, Whiteness, and Human Rights” included: Vera Rodrigues, professor in the Associated Program of Postgraduate Studies in Anthropology at UFC-UNILAB; Ana Y. Ramos Zayas, anthropologist, Bachelor in Economics and Latin American Studies from Yale College, and MA/PhD in Anthropology from Columbia University. This theme had repercussions throughout all the Circles, as it is a transversal theme related to the course’s main objectives.\nThe second Circle – “Human Rights and Mental Health: Anti-asylum Fight and Harm Reduction” - included: Haroldo Caetano, PhD in Psychology from the Federal University of Fluminense (UFF) and a member of the Public Ministry of the State of Goiás;

Marcus Giovani Moreira, PhD candidate in Sociology at UFC and member of VIESES.\nThe fourth Circle – “Memory, Justice, and Combating Torture” - included: Helena Vieira, Bachelor in Humanities at the Federal University of Integration of Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB); Pedro Paulo Bicalho, Associate Professor at the Institute of Psychology of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), representative of the Federal Council of Psychology on the National Committee for the Prevention and Combat of Torture (CNPCT), and president of the Regional Council of Psychology of Rio de Janeiro.\nThe fifth Circle – “Psychology, Human Rights, and Criminal Justice in Brazil” - included Luciano Goes, PhD candidate in Law at the University of Brasília (UnB); Ana Vládia Holanda Cruz, PhD in Psychology, professor at the FANOR Wyden University Center (UNIFANOR WYDE); and Franciane Santos, researcher at the Laboratory of Afro-Brazilian, Gender and Family Studies (NUAFRO/UECE).\nThe sixth Circle – “Traditional Peoples and Human Rights: Indigenous Issues” included Chief Adriana Tremembé, indigenous leader of the Tremembé people of Barra do Mundaú/CE; Juliana Alves, indigenous of the Jenipapo Kanindé people and Master’s student in Anthropology at the Federal University of Ceará (PPGA/UFC); Leonardo Barros Soares, professor at the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Graduate Program in Political Science at the Federal University of Pará (UFP) and member of the Laboratory and Group of Studies in Interethnic Relations at the University of Brasília (LAGERI/UnB).\nThe seventh Circle – “Human Rights Education” included: Cláudia Mayorga, professor in the Department of Psychology at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and the Graduate Program in Psychology, member of the Human Rights Commission of the Federal Council of Psychology, and Coordinator of the Itinerant Chair in Human Rights of the Association of Universities Grupo Montevideo; Letícia Carolina, transfeminist, professor at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI), PhD candidate in Education at UFPI, and member of the Center for Studies and Research in Education, Gender, and Citizenship (NEPEGECI/UFPI).\nThe eighth Circle – “LGBTQIA+ Youth and Collective Resistances” - included Jô Costa, non-binary artist, coordinator of “Gueto Queen,” the 1st LGBTQIA+ collective of Bom Jardim, coordinator of the Cia Viv’arte, and member of the Maracatu Nação Bom Jardim; Talles Azigon, writer, poet, and reading mediator, creator of Livro Livre Curió Community Library.\nThe ninth Circle – “Childhoods, Adolescences, Youth, and Human Rights,” included Camila Holanda Marinho, Professor and Researcher at the State University of Ceará (UECE) in the Social Sciences course, Itapipoca campus, and the Graduate Program in Public Policies, researcher at the Violence Studies Laboratory (LEV) and the Arts and Youth Laboratory (LAJUS), leader of the Research Group Travessias, and researcher at the Network of Studies and Research on Youth Actions and Experiences (REAJ); Leo Suricate, co-creator of “Suricate Seboso,” a humorous page originally created on Facebook in 2012, which portrays Northeastern culture and today has more than 6 million followers.\nThe tenth Circle – “Genders and Human Rights” - included Luma Nogueira, visiting researcher at the Center for Research and Studies in Sociology (CIES-ISCTE) of the University Institute of Lisbon and Adjunct Professor at the University of International Integration of Afro-Brazilian Lusophony (UNILAB); Kaciano Barbosa, Adjunct Professor of Sociology at the Federal University of Rio Grande (FURG) and member of the Center for Afro-Brazilian and Indigenous Studies at FURG; Anna Paula Uziel, professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ) and associate researcher at the Latin American Center on Sexuality and Human Rights (CLAM/IMS/ UERJ).\nThe eleventh Circle – “Homeless People (PSR) and Human Rights” - included Deivison Miranda, Master’s student in Psychology at the Federal University of Delta do Parnaíba (UFDPar); Eugênia Maciel, representative of the Pastoral for Street People, agent of the Pastoral in the Archdiocese and the house for Street People Dom Luciano Mendes, and worker at the Centro Pop de Fortaleza; Antônio Arlindo, artisan, militant for the life and income of the homeless population, representative of the National Movement of Homeless People (MNPR); Carlos Eduardo Esmeraldo Filho, psychologist, PhD in Psychology from UFC, professor of the Psychology course at the UniFanor University Center, and member of the Community Psychology Center (NUCOM).\nThe twelfth Circle – “Art, Culture, and Re-existences” included Glória Diógenes, professor of the Graduate Program in Sociology at UFC, researcher at the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development – CNPQ, and coordinator of the Arts and Youth Laboratory (LAJUS); Rômulo Silva, PhD candidate in the Graduate Program in Sociology at the State University (PPGS/UECE), member of the Violence and Conflict Studies Laboratory (COVIO/UECE), where he coordinates the research line “Afro-Atlantic Studies,” and collaborative researcher at the Contemporary Art Laboratory (LAC/UFC).\nAccording to our analyses, the course had the potential to produce in students the critical-reflective capacity and the engagement of Psychology in the issues circumscribed in the field of Human Rights. By historicizing this field, we discussed the universalization of Human Rights and the neoliberal rationality in power relations around the notion of humanity. Therefore, we debated in the course the context of inequality, the increase in urban violence, mass incarceration, LGBTQIA+phobia, structural racism, Brazilian sexism, the extermination of traditional peoples and ethnic and racial minorities, and how this impacts modes of subjectivation.\nThe large adherence to the course – whose registrations were all filled within the first two initial hours of public offering – showed the interest in formative spaces that provide connections between different epistemological currents and, given the virtual model, enabled the exchange with different thinkers of Psychology in Brazil, as well as with students and members of collectives and social movements that act in these plural and complex fields.\nIn general, conducting the course, involving different actors, was consolidated as an important device for tension and reinvention of what is understood by Human Rights in Psychology, especially in Social Psychology. The course also contributed to a comprehensive, decolonial, and critical-reflective training of students in facing contexts of vulnerabilities and life precarization, as well as collaborating for the (re)formulation of local strategies against Human Rights violations in Fortaleza.",

    "text": "14.4 Course “(Re)Existing at the Crossroads: Dialogues on Racial Relations, Gender, and Youth”\nThis course aimed to produce theoretical-methodological and experiential connections, approaches, and improvements regarding the implications of gender relations intersections in subjectivation modes in peripheral urban areas, agenced by violence scenarios and marked not only by oppression contexts but also by youth reexistences inserted in these territorialities, the difficulties for public policies that act in guaranteeing human rights, and for producing and promoting care practices in the face of violence and mortification produced by racism, LGBTQIA+phobia, and the intersections of other oppression markers.\nVIESES presents itself as a possibility of strengthening LGBTQIA+ people in Grande Bom Jardim. Since its insertion in the territory in 2018, the Program has carried out several research actions and has 4 extension projects in development in the territory, alongside infant-juvenile segments, in partnerships with public culture and education policies, non-governmental organizations, social movements, and collectives from the territory focused on defending human rights. Our initiatives aim to strengthen care promotion strategies, considering the psychosocial effects of sexual discrimination, LGBTQIA+phobia, and racism.\nAs known, Brazil is the country that most murders LGBTQIA+ people in the world, highlighting still the cruel and spectacularized way these deaths occur, with traces of misogynistic and LGBTQIA+phobic cruelty (Sousa et al., 2020). When observing these deaths and violations also through a racial lens, especially in peripheral contexts like the one we intend to act in, structural racism stands out as a necropolitical engine of violence plots (Costa et al., 2020). Thus, this reality reflects social structures that corroborate the formation of hatred against black and LGBTQIA+ people.\nWe also emphasize that the Brazilian scenario, especially with the advance of conservative ideas, has contributed to maintaining race, gender, and sexuality hierarchies, thus hindering advances regarding understanding and respect for the phenomenon of racism and gender identities and sexual orientations, although, in recent years, some laws have been achieved, such as stable union and the equating of homophobia to the crime of racism.\nRegarding the target audience, the course was aimed at Psychology and related areas students, professionals and managers working in public policies, members of civil society organizations, LGBTQIA+ youth from Grande Bom Jardim (GBJ), and the general community interested in discussing the proposed themes. The course had a total of 36 hours and took place from October to December 2022. It is important to point out that the first four meetings of the initial modules took place at the UFC Department of Psychology, while the final modules, from a territorialization perspective, were held at the Herbert de Souza Life Defense Center (CDVHS), aiming to strengthen the exchange and knowledge production in the dialogue between the university and the community, as 40% of the 45 places were reserved for participants who live or work in youth-focused equipment in GBJ.\nEight proposed modules were:\n\nGender: historical, conceptual aspects, and their intersections in youth trajectories and experiences;\nRacial Relations: historical, conceptual aspects, and their intersections in youth trajectories and experiences;\nPsychosocial effects of racism and LGBTQIA+phobia on youth mental health;\nGender inequalities and challenges for public policies and human rights guarantee;\nRacism and challenges for public policies and human rights guarantee;\nCare practices and facing LGBTQIA+phobia: theoretical-epistemic and clinical-political challenges and experiments;\nQuilombola practices and care policies against racism: theoretical-epistemic and clinical-political challenges and experiments;\nIntersectional dialogues between race, gender, class, generation, and territory: experiences and collective reexistences of youth in urban peripheries.\n\nBased on the accumulations built by extension experiences developed by VIESES since 2015 in various peripheries of Fortaleza and the formative proposals already experimented by the laboratory, the course adopted active, dialogical, and collaborative methodologies, prioritizing critical reading of reality, exchange of experiences among diverse participants, and contextualized deepening of contents related to race and gender relations, youth trajectories in urban territorialities, public policies for human rights guarantee, and clinical-political care practices. For this, pedagogical strategies were used, such as dialogued exposition, reading circles from texts, group work techniques, sharing social, professional, and academic experiences brought by the participants.",

    "text": "14.5 Final Considerations\nThe technical productions reported in this chapter (extension courses promoted by VIESES-UFC) have in common the aim of critically addressing themes related to Psychology praxis in defending Human Rights, proposing public policies to face violence, and producing knowledge from the university’s dialogue with different sectors and social groups.\nAnother common aspect of these technical productions is that all courses used methodologies that allowed the sharing of experiences, professional experience reports, research results, and theoretical reflections from Psychology and its interlocutions with related areas. These initiatives were also designed considering possible interventions in Psychology, being relevant for professional and academic performance in its most diverse fields.\nThe creation of such technical productions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of neofascist values and practices assumed that addressing the multifaceted field of Human Rights is fundamental for promoting an ethically committed Psychology training with transformations in the Brazilian context, which still coexists with strong coloniality marks and practices. To move against uncritical and reductionist approaches on the subject, both the communication products and the extension course reported were able to socialize realities and theoretical references of thinkers from Psychology and related areas that problematize cis-hetero-patriarchal-colonial-capitalist patterns.\nWe believe these technical productions linked to VIESES had the potential to strengthen and stimulate reflections on confronting inequalities and oppressions in Brazil. Furthermore, they sought to contribute to expanding the impact of the Graduate Program in Psychology at UFC in society, enhancing the resonance of discussions dear to VIESES since its creation. This is because, with the extension courses, especially those held remotely, these problematizations could reach from undergraduate and graduate students, professionals, whether from Psychology or related areas, to public policy managers and members of collectives, social movements, and civil society organizations from different regions of Brazil and even outside the national territory.",

    "text": "15.1 Introduction\nThis chapter aims to report the experience of constructing and facilitating the extension course “Socio-environmental Participatory Approaches and Methodologies,” developed by the Environmental Psychology Research Laboratory (Locus) at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC). Locus, linked to the UFC Psychology Department, has the hallmark of its academic production in the articulation between research, teaching, and extension, realizing the university tripod as described by the Ministry of Education.\nThe laboratory was established in 2003, bringing a socio-environmental perspective through an environmental, psychosocial, and socio-historical vision to understand the person-environment relationship, encompassing the physical, social, cultural, psychological, and political dimensions, and directing its studies and interventions to emerging societal demands (Pacheco et al., 2021). Theoretically and methodologically, Locus adopts an interdisciplinary perspective, considering the complexity of the phenomena studied and the multiplicity of factors involved in person-environment interactions, establishing contacts with the fields of Psychology, Education, Geography, Architecture, Urbanism, Sociology, Anthropology, Political Science, among others.\nIn the teaching sphere, Locus is related to Social Psychology and Environmental Psychology subjects at undergraduate and graduate levels. In the research sphere, the laboratory is linked to the UFC Graduate Program in Psychology (PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), developing master’s and doctoral research. In extension, it carries out actions with the university community and society in general, with its main projects being:\nIn 2020, Locus was involved in developing the extension course “Psychosocial Aspects of Vulnerabilities in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” organized by PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza and the Professional Graduate Program in Psychology and Public Policies at UFC (PPGPPPP-UFC/Sobral), being responsible for creating and teaching a module titled “Active and Participatory Methodologies in Facing COVID-19 with Indigenous Populations.” From this activity, considering the need for deeper discussions held in the module, the initiative to develop another extension course emerged to share Locus’s research, teaching, and extension experiences.\nThus, the course “Socio-environmental Participatory Approaches and Methodologies” was developed, aiming to expand the discussions that arose in the previous course. As such, other scenarios were encompassed, such as the city and its landscape aspects, indigenous peoples and transcultural issues, human development processes and learning, and experiences in social assistance and health public policies. The course aimed to present to the target audience (undergraduate and graduate students, professionals from various fields, and other members of society) socio-environmental methodologies based on Social Psychology and Environmental Psychology, intending to train interested people in facing environmental and social vulnerabilities.\nAmong the main objectives of the course, we sought to:\nThus, the course was organized into five main modules, addressing different knowledge areas, context problems, theoretical aspects, participatory methodologies, and research developed at Locus, PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza, and PPGPPPP-UFC/Sobral. The following details each of the modules.",

    "text": "15.2 Course Outline and Organization\nThe extension course provided a space for reflection on the content covered by the subjects Theories and Practices in Social Psychology III, Environmental Psychology, among others, at undergraduate and graduate levels. Beyond teaching, the course also directly dialogued with research conducted by PPGP and PPGPPPP master’s and doctoral students.\nConsidering the need for physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the course was held remotely with synchronous and asynchronous moments. Thus, the meetings were held online once a week, every Friday in August and the first Friday in September 2020, from 4 pm to 6 pm, via Google Meet platform, lasting 2 hours/class. To account for the 20-hour certificate issuance, besides the 10 hours of synchronous meetings, readings and activities were made available on the Google Classroom platform to complement discussions and reflections asynchronously.\nAs for course registrations, these were conducted virtually through the Google Forms platform in July 2020. Initially, the course organizing team planned to offer 100 vacancies; however, given the high demand identified, 162 registrations were made. Regarding the profile of registrants, besides undergraduate, specialization, master’s, and doctoral students, professionals from public policies, members of non-governmental organizations, participants of social movements, collectives, and community leaders also participated.

    "text": "15.3 Facilitation of Thematic Axes: Exchanges of Experiences and Teaching\nThroughout the extension course, discussions were held on how socio-environmental and historical-cultural perspectives contribute to understanding the social problems of the national context. Concepts from specific areas (Psychology, Geography, Education, Architecture and Urbanism, Sociology, etc.) were addressed, relating them to the studied contexts, methods, and facilitation processes that contribute to field insertion, needs assessment, action development, knowledge construction and sharing, etc., from a participatory perspective, involving professionals, students, and residents of the studied contexts.\nThese experiences, from a historical-cultural (Lane, 1989; Vygotsky, 1996), decolonial (Santos & Meneses, 2009), and ethical-political (Martin-Baró, 2011; 2017; Sawaia, 2009, 2011) standpoint, allowed the development of approaches and actions in various research and intervention fields, configuring active and participatory methodological proposals (Freire, 1980; Montero, 2007). These methodologies developed stem from the need to reach populations in situations of social and environmental vulnerability, inequality, and ethical-political suffering.\nThe methodologies presented in the course also went beyond a solely psychological science focus, seeking transdisciplinarity as a way to create a new field encompassing various disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of environmental, social, and human problems, allowing the emergence of knowledge connecting Psychology, Education, Geography, Environmental Sciences, Social Sciences, and other areas, to embrace the cultural and methodological diversity required.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic context, a readaptation to the social isolation reality was made, demanding greater course insertion in the community more accessible through online platforms, reaching many people. In total, the course had five meetings, each corresponding to a module within broad thematic axes. Below, we present the main characteristics of each module.\n\n15.3.1 Theoretical and Participatory Methodological Perspectives\nThis module was facilitated by Andie de Castro Lima (master’s student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), Fábio Pinheiro Pacheco (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), and Zulmira Bomfim, the instrument’s author and Locus coordinator. A total of 88 participants attended.\nIn this meeting, the course construction was presented, contextualizing how the idea emerged and how it was organized. An introduction to the theoretical and methodological bases of Socio-historical Social Psychology (Lane & Codo, 1989) and Environmental Psychology from a transactional perspective (Bomfim, 2010; Mira, 1997) was also conducted, highlighting how these two combine to construct a socio-environmental perspective within Locus. The participatory aspects in the articulation between teaching, research, and extension were also discussed. At this moment, the importance of participatory methods in facilitating psychosocial actions aimed at social transformation (Freire, 1980; Montero, 2007) was emphasized.\nOn the occasion, the Affective Maps Generator Instrument (Bomfim, 2010; Bomfim et al., 2014), developed by Locus coordinator Zulmira Bomfim from her doctoral thesis in 2003, was also presented. Integrating the aforementioned theoretical bases, Bomfim (2010) outlined an instrument capable of creating affective maps, through which one can capture the socio-affective synthesis of an individual’s encounter with a place, whether it is the home, the neighborhood, the city, etc.\n\n\n15.3.2 Human Development, Professional Training, and Participation\nIn this second module, the discussion focused on the dialogue between personal and collective development, participation in culture, lifelong development, and the repercussions on educational processes. The psychosocial aspects of psychology training and the psychologist’s work in education and art as an intercultural proposal were also discussed. The module was facilitated by Nara Maria Forte Diogo Rocha (Professor at the UFC Psychology Department in Fortaleza and PPGPPPP-UFC/Sobral), Helenira Fonseca de Alencar (Ph.D. in Education), Janaína Farias de Melo (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), and Benedito Rodrigues (master’s student at PPGPP-Sobral). A total of 101 participants attended.\nTo discuss personal and collective development and participation in culture, the “Life in Verse” dynamic (Haiku) was conducted to express the relationship between humans and nature from a perspective on possible life changes. Additionally, it was relevant to address, in the educational field, the experience of the flipped classroom (conducting group activities and exercises and professor attendance), different from the traditional classroom (professor lectures to students). Finally, the experience of the school psychologist creating spaces for student discourse circulation and the re-signification of daily life with new group-created activities were addressed.\n\n\n15.3.3 Indigenous Peoples and Transcultural Issues\nThe third module’s discussion focused on the community insertion process (Montero, 2007) in indigenous villages and other traditional communities. Emphasis was placed on how initial contacts are established and how participatory research and extension are delineated, considering subject participation. The module was facilitated by Maria Zelfa de Souza Feitosa (post-doctoral researcher at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), Francisco Jésus Dias Mota Araújo (master’s student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), Janaína Farias de Melo (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), and Halaine Cristina Pessoa Bento (master’s student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza). A total of 92 participants attended.\nIn the module, Francisco Jésus chose to bring a discussion on interculturality from a decolonial dialogue (Santos & Meneses, 2009) in Serra dos Encantados (Aratuba), Pacatuba, Ceará: the affects and actions with the Pitaguary people. From the Locus Program and her doctoral thesis, Zelfa Feitosa presented her experience as a researcher within the Pitaguary indigenous village, addressing the community insertion process and outlining her doctoral thesis, which studied the rights of indigenous peoples, understanding the affects and conflicts involved in the experiences of indigenous leaders (Feitosa, 2019). Additionally, Zelfa also presented the “Game as a socio-cultural, collaborative intervention and potency for action” (Feitosa, 2019), an activity developed with indigenous children from the said village.\nIn this sense, seeking new methodological possibilities for affective maps (Bomfim, 2010), Janaína de Melo addressed the outline of her doctoral research in the field of transculturality between Ceará and Japan from the perspective of young people from Ceará. Thus, she brought a reflection on subjects from their social and cultural aspects, understanding spaces as dynamic, in constant symbolic construction (Tavares, 2014).\nContinuing the discussions on cultures in Brazil, Halaine Pessoa presented her master’s research with the Venezuelan migrant and refugee population, arriving through the state of Roraima in search of better living conditions. Thus, a look from Environmental Psychology in the sphere of experience, living, meanings, and appropriation of spaces by Venezuelans with Brazilian territory (Moser, 1998) was presented, as well as her experience with this public in a shelter for Venezuelan refugees from Operation Welcome in Boa Vista (RR).\n\n\n15.3.4 Public Health and Social Assistance Policies\nModule four presented the areas of Social Assistance and Health, making an interlocution with Environmental Psychology and Social Psychology. The participatory methodologies used in these contexts, in the fields of work, research, and teaching, emphasized issues related to the importance of territorialization in professional practices in the highlighted public policies and the understanding of affective elements involved in socially vulnerable and risky situations experienced by policy users.\nThe module was facilitated by Andie de Castro Lima (master’s student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), José Reginaldo Feijão Parente (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), Elcides Hellen Ferreira Landim Barreto (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), and Cícera Mônica da Silva Sousa Martins (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza). A total of 83 participants attended the module.\nThe activity was conducted based on research and intervention experiences in two public policy fields: Health and Social Assistance. The choice of these themes was based on the understanding of health and social assistance policies as the main fields of psychology professionals’ action in the public sector, both on the front line, attending the population, and in management processes and training of workers in the Unified Health System (SUS) and the Unified Social Assistance System (SUAS).\nTo this end, the class was conducted in two stages: a theoretical conceptual moment, on the fundamental bases for understanding the functioning of SUS and SUAS, and later, the presentation of the Affective Maps Generator Instrument - IGMA (Bomfim, 2010; Bomfim et al., 2014), as a research and intervention tool in the aforementioned fields. The two facilitators of the first moment not only focused on discussing the organizational structure and services provided by Health and Social Assistance policies but also began a debate on the importance of the psychologist’s social commitment in acting in the public policy field (Sawaia, 2009).\nNext, two application situations of the IGMA methodology were presented in two facilities: a Basic Health Unit (UBS) in the city of Icó, and a Social Assistance Reference Center (CRAS) in the city of Maracanaú, Fortaleza’s metropolitan region. Initially, Hellen Barreto presented the construction process and results of her research, discussing how understanding the affects present in UBS can expand the possibilities of more effective actions and services, greater user involvement with a healthy lifestyle (Barreto, 2017).\nSubsequently, Andie Lima and Mônica Martins brought the discussion of affects to the social assistance sphere. At this point, the main results of research and actions developed at CRAS were presented, focusing on the importance of territorialization and understanding the affective elements that permeate the appropriation of this territory by residents (A. de C. Lima, 2019). The examples presented showed the potential of IGMA both for diagnosing residents’ links with accessed public policy facilities and for intervention and evocation of reflections on the importance of understanding affects in the process of implementing and conducting public policy.\n\n\n15.3.5 Cities, Sociocultural Movements, and Participation\nIn the final stage, a discussion was held on cultural spaces, constructing participation and resistance in urban social movements. This module was facilitated by Fábio Pinheiro Pacheco (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), José Reginaldo Feijão Parente (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), Cícera Mônica da Silva Sousa Martins (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza), and Daniel Welton Arruda Cabral (doctoral student at PPGP-UFC/Fortaleza). A total of 77 participants attended. The module presented methods and facilitation processes for research, teaching, and extension, highlighting socio-environmental (Morais et al., 2011) and cultural trails as possibilities for reflection-action and collective construction; and the organization of social movements of struggle (Cabral, 2015; Martins, 2020) and resistance to socio-spatial segregation situations (Pacheco, 2018).\nInitially, Reginaldo Parente started a discussion on cultural heritage and affectivity to address his doctoral research outline experience. In his thesis, he focused on the phenomenon of affects experienced in relation to cultural heritage in the context of the city of Sobral-Ceará, discussing the social implications and infrastructural development present in person-environment relationships (Parente, 2020). Next, Daniel Cabral addressed the organization of residents of Prainha do Canto Verde, discussing lifestyles, solidarity bonds, cooperation, and claim processes in constructing social and political participation and struggle (Cabral, 2015).\nFinally, Fábio Pacheco and Mônica Martins brought a discussion on space expropriation processes. Fábio Pacheco addressed the importance of action research (Montero, 2007) and the development of community activities (Góis, 2005). Based on his master’s research, he discussed the psychosocial implications present in space expropriation processes (Pacheco et al., 2020), reaffirming that real estate speculation accentuates the segregational nature of urban development, impacting the lives of the poor population targeted for removals (Pacheco, 2018). Bringing the discussion to the rural context, Mônica Martins presented her experience of community insertion and research outline, discussing the psychosocial impacts of the Ceará water belt works and the resistance practices developed by the population (Martins, 2020).\nAll modules were based on theoretical and methodological perspectives in the mentioned areas, considering social inequalities and vulnerabilities context, as well as the social exclusion-inclusion dialectic, decolonial theories, and indigenous peoples (Santos & Meneses, 2011). The presentation showed how Latin American Social Psychology (Lane, 1989; Martin-Baró, 2011) and transactional-based Environmental Psychology (Bomfim, 2010; Mira, 1997) contribute to understanding socio-environmental phenomena in a theoretical-practical way. The affectivity category (Sawaia, 2011) stood out as an axis for observation, investigation, intervention, and analysis to overcome psychological science’s own dichotomies that separate subjectivity from objectivity, rationality from affects, the individual from the social, among others that approach a prescribed posture and naturalize the social exclusion-inclusion dialectic.",

    "text": "15.4 Learning Process and Evaluation\nAt the end of the fifth module, students were asked to fill out an evaluation form to understand the learning process throughout the course and measure the impact of the topics covered during the students’ professional trajectory. The evaluation form was created on the G Suite platform (Google Forms) in an electronic questionnaire format, evaluating five aspects: Virtual Environment, Pedagogical Aspects, Technical Support, Teaching Team and Moderation, and Self-evaluation. Each of the five topics mentioned above presented objective questions with five agreement scale alternatives, with numbers between 1 (totally disagree) and 5 (totally agree).\nAt the end of the form, there was a comment section with questions about interest in participating in other actions promoted by Locus, suggestions for themes for future training, and other remarks. Although adherence to the evaluation form was voluntary, 45 registrants filled out this evaluative instrument. The results were analyzed and compiled by the event organizing committee.\nRegarding the first topic, the virtual environment, the eight alternatives concerned the use of the chosen virtual platforms for conducting the course (Google Classroom, Google Forms, and Google Meet). In all alternatives, more than 90% of students evaluated the choice and conduction satisfactorily, marking “agree” and “totally agree.” In the final question, asking for an overall opinion on the experience in the course’s virtual environments, the satisfaction rate was unanimously positive, obtaining the following percentages, agree (19.5%) and totally agree (80.5%).\nIn the additional comments section on the “virtual environment” topic, students stated they were in the process of adapting to these tools, especially in activities conducted during this pandemic period. As a suggestion, the need to bring more reading indications available for download in the Classroom was pointed out, and the notifications received by email for each posted content were praised.\nIn the second topic, concerning pedagogical aspects, the nine statements addressed the format, duration, and content of the classes presented in the five modules. Satisfaction rates regarding the content, format, and day of the course were 82.9%, comparable to what was presented in additional comments and suggestions. In this space, students pointed out that the chosen content met their needs and that the teachers’ methodology was effective.\nHowever, a common complaint about the duration of each module class was noted. Students considered the two-hour duration short and saw it as limiting the teachers’ speaking time. Participants requested that in future courses offered by Locus, classes have longer durations and, if necessary, the theme be divided over more than one day for greater content absorption. Some also suggested new courses to deepen the presented themes, such as territory, public policies, and sustainability.\nIn the third evaluative topic, the effectiveness and service provision by the course technical support were addressed. The five alternatives concerned the response time and effectiveness of the support, as well as the quality of the service provided. In the final evaluative alternative, over 90% satisfaction with the services was obtained. In the additional comments section, the promptness, quick responses to demands, attention, and student reception were praised. Some participants reported not needing support services, while others expressed satisfaction with the service when sought.\nThe fourth topic addressed the performance of the teaching and mediation team, with eleven alternatives aimed at evaluating the topics presented by the teachers, teaching methodology, teacher-student interaction, clarification of doubts, and the role of moderation in the process. The average response per alternative was over 90% satisfaction with teachers and mediators, considering the percentage compilation of each question. In the additional comments section, participants reported that they not only approved the way the classes of each module were conducted but also noticed the effort and dedication of the team, as well as the care and study devoted to each theme. It was also mentioned that in future courses, it would be interesting to have a folder with complementary bibliographic materials on the theme of each module to expand the acquired knowledge.\nIn the final evaluative topic, self-evaluation, the thirteen statements addressed technical, pedagogical, and experiential questions of the students regarding their experience as course students. Factors such as motivation to participate in classes, course contribution to professional training, interest in the covered content, participation, and understanding of presented content were mostly evaluated positively. Most students did not have difficulties managing the Classroom and Meet platforms, although 19.5% of students had problems with internet access.\nRegarding the applicability of the presented content to their professional career and curriculum, most students were in favor of reapplying what was learned in their daily activities, with 22% agreement and 78% total agreement. In the additional comments, students reported being happy to participate in the course and considering the use of the presented methodologies in their professional and academic activities.\nAdditionally, some mentioned the relation of the discussed themes with their final course projects and research lines, reaffirming the interest in themes related to active methodologies in environmental psychology. In the suggestions box, it was requested that future courses have modules with longer class durations and breaks during classes. Some themes expected for future Locus training were also suggested, such as research in urban environments, affectivity and territory, pro-environmental behavior, ecological commitment, practices in environmental psychology; an intensive course on IGMA, restorative environments, well-being, and current environmental issues were also suggested.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe training of researchers is essential both for the quality of empirical research and for promoting the technical and economic development of a country. Through representation and inferential analysis tools, Statistics provides a better understanding of events when there is a large amount of data, variability, and uncertainties (Estevam & Kalinke, 2013). Furthermore, the teaching of Statistics has gained more visibility due to the current market demand for professionals who can handle large amounts of information and master data analysis techniques, anticipating decision-making inferred from sample data (Vendramini & Brito, 2001).\nIt is also necessary that, due to this visibility, there is greater care in the technical application of data interpretation, considering the expectation of finding the truth through these instruments (Cordani, 2001). Thus, there is a need to expand the training opportunities for professionals capable of handling this demand.\nThe increased processing capacity of personal computers has enabled relatively complex statistical analyses to be performed by a wide range of people. In this context, several programs have emerged to facilitate such analyses. However, the most commonly used and popular applications are paid and have closed code, meaning that their source code is not open to the public, only the developers or the company owning the software rights have this knowledge. Thus, acquiring licenses is often prohibitively expensive.\nIn this sense, the R programming language has become popular as a versatile and powerful tool for statistical data analysis, as it is free and open-source, allowing users to view, use, and modify it according to specific license terms, promoting transparency and user collaboration for its development. Additionally, there are numerous developers creating countless packages that expand R’s analytical possibilities. An R package is a collection of functions, data, documentation, and other resources that can be installed and used in R. Packages organize and share code and data and can be used to extend R’s functionality.\nMoreover, the user community interacts strongly and provides mutual support, clarifying doubts, evaluating error messages, and helping find the best path for analyses, graph construction, tables, and more. Additionally, the R Studio application provides a user-friendly graphical interface that facilitates the use of R. Together, R and R Studio enable everything from simple analyses to the construction of complex statistical models.",

    "section": "\n2 About MOOCs",
    "text": "2 About MOOCs\nIn this context, we need to consider the ease with which postmodern society accesses information. This allows the search for academic and professional knowledge to occur in various ways beyond traditional means. Therefore, it is pertinent to adopt tools that assist in learning Statistics, such as Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). When used appropriately, ICTs can be powerful in this task, favoring the understanding of statistical and probabilistic concepts. ICTs provide easy and agile access to the application of learned content (Estevam & Kalinke, 2013).\nIn this scenario, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) can be cited as an example. These are courses offered online, free of charge and openly, without the need for prerequisites. Notably, there is no participant limit, allowing for a broad audience (Dal Forno & Knoll, 2014).\nThe methods used in MOOCs are often fluid. Most promote interaction and aim for collaborative education. Conversely, others have a traditional approach where the teacher is the primary knowledge source and dictates the steps students will follow (Cid Bastos & Biagiotti, 2014).\nMOOCs were introduced as distance education models in 2008 but only gained traction in 2012 through investments, scaling up and gaining popularity, contributing globally to higher education (Gonçalves & Gonçalves, 2014). Thus, MOOCs have at least ten years of contribution to education, offering a wide range of courses in various areas and levels of knowledge, both technical and scientific.\nIn this context, MOOCs can richly contribute to learning, as they are accessible and can occur alongside other forms of education, such as Higher Education courses, providing autonomy in managing completion time. Additionally, by offering self-directed learning, students can revisit topics needing more attention according to their needs. MOOCs also facilitate interaction with other students, providing experience exchange and tips, further aiding the learning process.\n\n2.1 MOOCs for learning data analysis with R\nIn 2023, a Google search reveals some Brazilian courses related to R education. The Coursera platform offers several MOOCs, including a specific one on Data Analysis with R programming at an intermediate level, provided by Google Career Certificates (Google, 2022). Another example is found on the Federal Institute of Espírito Santo’s (IFES) MOOC platform, called Statistics with R, aimed at students interested in data analysis using statistical methods with this research tool (Instituto Federal do Espírito Santo, 2024). The Federal Government’s Virtual School of Government also offers a course called Data Analysis in R Language, primarily teaching R language use for data preparation and exploration (Escola Nacional de Administração Pública, 2022).\nAdditionally, English MOOCs on R education are also available. Coursera offers, besides the aforementioned Portuguese course, others like “Introduction to R Programming for Data Science” by IBM (IBM, 2024) and “Data Science: Foundations using R” by Johns Hopkins University (Johns Hopkins University, 2024).\nGiven this, it is essential to highlight the importance of different MOOCs on the same subject because, concerning the mentioned courses, there are differences in knowledge levels and skills addressed. For instance, the Coursera platform’s course is intermediate, the government’s course is specific to its application in Statistics, and the IFES course has advanced content in Statistics but only gives basic notions of R. Moreover, courses in English can hinder access for Brazilian students not proficient in the language.\nMoreover, courses have different pedagogical approaches that can suit students differently, positively or negatively, especially when MOOCs cater to a broad audience with pre-established knowledge and specific needs. Thus, a variety of courses enhances these individuals’ choice of what and how they prefer to study.\nAnother important factor is that, in the case of the R language, being open-source, it is constantly evolving. This can make courses obsolete, requiring content updates.\n\n2.2 The proposal of the MOOC “Introduction to R for data analysis in Psychology”\nThis report presents the MOOC “Introduction to R for data analysis in Psychology,” aiming to help researchers and students transition from proprietary software and/or graphical interfaces to a free, flexible programming language.\nThis proposal differs from other R courses in Brazil and other countries because, despite their excellence, the learning is directed towards Data Science or Statistics. Thus, the content and its presentation are more complex and diverge from the routine tasks required by Psychology or Humanities and Social Sciences researchers.\nThe goal is not to exhaust R’s possibilities as a programming language but to adapt them to the needs of the mentioned areas. Additionally, the intention is for this language to be learned intuitively. Coding with R’s basic functions is very powerful and can implement advanced solutions, but it does not seem to have been created to adapt to everyday language.\nAt this point, using a set of packages called tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) brings coding closer to natural language, making it readable by both computers and humans, known as literate programming. Verbs, adverbs, nouns, and pronouns facilitate understanding where one starts and intends to go with the used functions. Here, there is a small drawback: all functions are in English, so some knowledge of the language facilitates learning. Thus, this MOOC might be better characterized as a workshop on R through tidyverse.\nFurthermore, an initial formation generates the possibility of using courses that require prior knowledge, like those previously mentioned. Therefore\n, the course aims to develop technical skills for data analysis in the Humanities, using R. Moreover, it intends to add critical knowledge that aids in data interpretation.",

    "section": "\n3 Method",
    "text": "3 Method\nThe course formulation followed these stages: needs analysis (presented in the introduction), planning, implementation, and execution (Fassbinder et al., 2014). Clarifying these points is essential to understand how the MOOC will be conducted and executed and the process by which it was built.\n\n3.1 Planning\nThe planning phase involves structuring the MOOC. It includes how the content will be presented, the development team, the linked platform, and the costs or profits of the course. Following this logic, it was decided to use recorded video lessons presented by Professor Dr. Francisco Pablo Huascar Aragão Pinheiro for content presentation. As will be seen later, during this report’s elaboration, the course was conducted in a pilot format with live classes via Google Meet that were recorded. Thus, the decision on the platform through which the course will be available will be made later.\nThe project development team is linked to the Laboratory of Practices and Research in Psychology and Education (LAPPSIE) at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC) Sobral campus. A group within this laboratory has dedicated itself to producing quantitative research in Work Psychology, such as “Student health in a public university: a study in the Brazilian northeast” (Vieira et al., 2022), “Prevalence and predictors of common mental disorders among university professors in the interior of Ceará” (Vieira et al., 2023), and “Characteristics of violence against public school teachers” (Pinheiro et al., 2020). LAPPSIE is also committed to teaching quantitative research techniques, especially in Psychology, such as the course presented here.\nThe MOOC is not intended for profit and will be made available free of charge, as UFC’s mission is to disseminate knowledge within and outside the university, adhering to the inseparable principle of teaching, research, and extension. These three pillars connect to contribute significantly to building a free, just, and supportive society.\n\n3.2 Implementation\nDuring the implementation, the didactic material on which the course will be based is evaluated, and activities are created and developed. The presented workshop currently bases itself on the books “R for Data Science” (Wickham & Grolemund, 2023) and “Statistical inference via data science: A ModernDive into R and the tidyverse” (Ismay & Kim, 2022). The first is popular among data scientists and others who want to learn to use the R programming language. It is known for using the “tidy data” approach, which allows organizing data to facilitate its manipulation and visualization. The second presents practical concepts and computational methods and uses the R language and the tidyverse package set for data analysis.\nSets of slides, exercise blocks, and their respective solutions were developed, all made available on a page initially built to host the course content https://fphap.quarto.pub/rpsi/. These materials were developed using R coding through the Quarto tool, a markup language that creates dynamic documents, reproducible reports, and more. It can also be used to create educational materials like interactive tutorials, exercises, slide presentations, and books (like the one you’re reading).\nSo far, six modules have been developed for the workshop, and a module on regression is under construction. Discussions on descriptive statistics and more basic analyses such as correlation, t-test, ANOVA, and chi-square will be added soon. The following presents the already elaborated modules and a sample of what is learned in each.\n\n3.2.1 Introduction to R\nThis module introduces the minimum necessary to familiarize oneself with R’s basic language (R Core Team, 2022). When dealing with basic coding, there is not always a transposition of what is done in software with a graphical interface, but this initial step is essential to understand how R works by itself.\n\n\nListing 1: Introduction to R\n\nExemplo: função seq()\nThe first two arguments of the seq function are from and to\n\n# Crie uma sequência de números de 1 a 10\nseq(from = 1, to = 10)\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nThird argument: by\n\n# Agora, o incremento da sequência é por 2\nseq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2)\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n\nIf the argument values are in the function order, you can omit them\n\nseq(1,10,2)\n\n[1] 1 3 5 7 9\n\n\nUse the rnorm function and create an object called hundred with 100 cases, mean of 30, and standard deviation of 4. You can see the function arguments with ?rnorm.1\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Data Transformation\nBefore analyzing the collected data, some essential tasks are necessary, such as creating variables from those initially collected, filtering values, and arranging them in ascending or descending order. It may also be necessary to select, rename, and reposition variables. Summarizing some results is also important in this data manipulation phase. All these tasks can be done with the dplyr package (Wickham, François, et al., 2023). Learning how dplyr works will be the main goal of this module.\n\n\nListing 2: Data Transformation\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nThe ufo_sightings.csv dataset will be used. This data provides information about unidentified flying object sightings. To obtain the data, run the following code:\n\nufo &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/ufo_sightings.csv\")\n\nRows: 96429 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (7): city, state, country_code, shape, reported_duration, summary, day_...\ndbl  (1): duration_seconds\nlgl  (1): has_images\ndttm (2): reported_date_time, reported_date_time_utc\ndate (1): posted_date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nExercise\nSightings occur in various US states. What is the average duration (in hours) in the state with the most cigar-shaped object sightings?\n\nufo |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    dur_horas = duration_seconds/3600\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(country_code == \"US\",\n         shape == \"cigar\") |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    n = n(),\n    M = mean(dur_horas)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(n))\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 3\n   state     n      M\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 CA      250 2.39  \n 2 FL      146 1.74  \n 3 TX      119 2.91  \n 4 NY      109 2.63  \n 5 WA       90 1.13  \n 6 PA       88 2.95  \n 7 OH       76 2.03  \n 8 NC       72 2.42  \n 9 IL       68 0.114 \n10 OR       68 0.0798\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\nAnswer: 2.39 hours\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Iteration\nIn the tidyverse context, iteration refers to repeatedly performing the same action on different objects. It is possible, for instance, with the summarise function, to calculate the mean and standard deviation of several columns at once or transform them with the mutate function. Iteration is important as it avoids copying and pasting functions more than twice, which can propagate errors in the code. This is a very powerful tidyverse capability; however, given the workshop’s introductory nature, the focus will be on the across() function.\n\n\nListing 3: Iteration\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\nCreating a dummy dataset\n\ndf &lt;- tibble(\n  a = rnorm(10),\n  b = rnorm(10),\n  c = rnorm(10),\n  d = rnorm(10)\n)\n\ndf\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n        a       b      c       d\n    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  0.707 -0.373  -0.451  0.206 \n 2  0.380 -1.24    0.125 -1.64  \n 3  0.335  0.343  -1.79  -0.594 \n 4  0.603  1.32   -0.358  0.0809\n 5 -0.229 -1.92    0.202 -1.66  \n 6  0.225  1.00   -1.72   2.23  \n 7 -0.600  0.566   0.246  0.0775\n 8  0.281 -1.64    1.79  -1.94  \n 9 -0.598  0.0839  0.256 -0.445 \n10  0.816 -0.347  -1.15  -0.0735\n\n\nacross()\n\n.cols =: specifies which columns will be iterated\n.fns =: says what to do with the columns\n\nWhich function to apply\n\n\n\n\ndf |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    across(.cols = a:d,.fns = median)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n      a      b      c      d\n  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 0.308 -0.131 -0.117 -0.259\n\n\nExercise\nIn the economics dataset, calculate the mean of the pce, pop, and psavert variables using the across function.\n\neconomics |&gt; \n  print(n = 3)\n\n# A tibble: 574 × 6\n  date         pce    pop psavert uempmed unemploy\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 1967-07-01  507. 198712    12.6     4.5     2944\n2 1967-08-01  510. 198911    12.6     4.7     2945\n3 1967-09-01  516. 199113    11.9     4.6     2958\n# ℹ 571 more rows\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Data Import\nWorking with the datasets that come with R and some packages is important, but this module will allow bringing datasets into R. Importing is a simple task but can have nuances requiring attention. You will learn to import csv (comma-separated values), csv2 (semicolon-separated values), .sav (SPSS), and .xlsx (Excel) files. Some tips on organizing data and variable names and exporting them in csv format will also be addressed. The packages readr (Wickham et al., 2024), haven (Wickham, Miller, et al., 2023), and readxl (Wickham & Bryan, 2023) will be used.\n\n\nListing 4: Data Import\n\nHandling codes for missing values\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nestudantes &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/estudantes.csv\", \n                       na = c(\"N/A\",\"\")) \n\nestudantes\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  `ID do Aluno` `Nome Completo`  `Comida Favorita`  `Plano de Refeição`    Idade\n          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n1             1 Sunil Huffmann   Iogurte de Morango Apenas Almoço          4    \n2             2 Barclay Lynn     Batata Frita       Apenas Almoço          5    \n3             3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Café da Manhã e Almoço 7    \n4             4 Leon Rossini     Anchovas           Apenas Almoço          NA   \n5             5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Café da Manhã e Almoço Cinco\n6             6 Güvenç Attila    Sorvete            Apenas Almoço          6    \n\n\nImproving variable names\n\nSpaces: variables between ``\nUppercase and lowercase\nAccents and special characters\n\njanitor::clean_names()\n\n\n\n\nestudantes &lt;- estudantes |&gt; \n  clean_names()\n\nestudantes\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  id_do_aluno nome_completo    comida_favorita    plano_de_refeicao      idade\n        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;chr&gt;\n1           1 Sunil Huffmann   Iogurte de Morango Apenas Almoço          4    \n2           2 Barclay Lynn     Batata Frita       Apenas Almoço          5    \n3           3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Café da Manhã e Almoço 7    \n4           4 Leon Rossini     Anchovas           Apenas Almoço          NA   \n5           5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Café da Manhã e Almoço Cinco\n6           6 Güvenç Attila    Sorvete            Apenas Almoço          6    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Plots\nGraphs are an essential tool for data exploration and making result presentations more intelligible, avoiding solely relying on the dryness of tables. For this, an indispensable tool is the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). This module will introduce some functions for creating simple graphs and others for controlling various elements of the desired figure.\n\n\nListing 5: Plots\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nTwo numerical variables\n\ngeom_point()\ngeom_smooth()\n\n\nggplot(penguins,\n       aes(flipper_length_mm, \n           body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\"\n    )\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range\n(`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\nRecreate the graph below using the starwars dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Tidy Data\nThis may be the module that most diverges from the routine of Psychology and Humanities researchers. Usually, data is collected, and when imported or entered into spreadsheets, it already has a tidy format. This format refers to: “Each variable is a column; each column is a variable. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value” (Ismay & Kim, 2022).\nHowever, working with publicly available datasets or data not directly collected is not uncommon. Hence, it is essential to organize them for tidy data analysis. The pivot_longer() function will be explored for this purpose.\nRules for a tidy dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Tidy data. From: R for Data Science\n\n\n“The following three rules make a dataset tidy: variables are columns, observations are rows, and values are cells” (Wickham & Grolemund, 2023, sec. 5.2, Tidy data).\n\n3.2.7 Linear Regression\nLinear regression is a simple statistical analysis but a fundamental tool for solving many problems researchers face daily. This module will cover basic concepts and their implementation in R. Besides the lm() function, part of R’s base, some tidymodels packages will be used. tidymodels is a set of tools and packages that provides a consistent and organized approach to statistical modeling and machine learning, following tidyverse principles of organization and clarity. It facilitates building, evaluating, and fine-tuning statistical models efficiently and intuitively.\n\n\nListing 6: Linear Regression\n\nSimple Linear Regression: One Categorical Independent Variable\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\ntmcs &lt;- read_csv(\"./data/contexto_sm.csv\")\n\nRows: 1000 Columns: 98\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (12): genero, cor_raca, escolaridade, estado_civil, renda_pos_pandemia, ...\ndbl (86): a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, e1, e2, e3...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n# Criação da variável TMCS\ntmcs &lt;- tmcs |&gt; \n  rowwise() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    tmcs = sum(c_across(srq1:srq20))\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup()\n\nDifferences Between Means\n\nt.test(tmcs ~ fct_relevel(grupo_de_risco, \"Sim\"), data = tmcs,var.equal = T)\n\n\n    Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  tmcs by fct_relevel(grupo_de_risco, \"Sim\")\nt = 3.0395, df = 998, p-value = 0.002431\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Sim and group Não is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.3887405 1.8051091\nsample estimates:\nmean in group Sim mean in group Não \n         5.630081          4.533156 \n\n\n\nfit_cat &lt;- lm(tmcs ~ grupo_de_risco, data = tmcs) \n\n\nsummary(fit_cat)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = tmcs ~ grupo_de_risco, data = tmcs)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-5.630 -4.533 -1.533  3.370 15.467 \n\nCoefficients:\n                  Estimate Std.

As mentioned earlier, the course was facilitated synchronously on Google Meet and recorded. It was a pilot application aimed at evaluating various aspects to improve its final version.\nThus, attention was given to slide quality, content presentation, interaction with exercises, and the impact of classes on the learning process. The participants’ involvement and evaluation throughout this process are crucial for the MOOC’s formulation, as there will be no direct contact with students in its full execution.\nIn this pilot application, the facilitator used slides to organize content presentation and performed coding alongside explanations. The slides also included exercises applying the introduced functions. Thus, explanations were interspersed with moments for participants to solve these exercises. Additionally, the website hosts exercise blocks corresponding to each course module, individually solved by participants, followed by a joint resolution meeting.\nAs the MOOC is still in the planning process, no specific registration period date has been set. However, it is expected to be completed by 2024.",

A self-assessment of the MOOC proposal will be presented, considering the following criteria: impact, coverage, potential reach (expansion possibility), replicability, complexity, demand, and innovation (technological advancement).\nRegarding impact, the course is relevant as it serves as an entry point for researchers in Psychology and the Humanities who need to perform statistical analyses and transition from proprietary software to free, robust, and reliable tools like R.\nThe course’s utility lies in facilitating learning for people unfamiliar with programming languages by directing content to routine activities in the mentioned fields’ research. Similarly, the literate programming approach is relevant as it facilitates learning by bringing natural language closer to software language.\nThe course will have international reach as it will be available online, allowing access to Portuguese speakers. Potential reach refers to expansion and course update possibilities. Expansion can be achieved by creating new modules that extend introductory content and including others that present advanced R data analysis tools. Additionally, the modules need periodic updates, as the presented packages are constantly improved, which could render them obsolete if not kept up-to-date.\nThe course will have high replicability potential, as all produced content will be released under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International), allowing others to remix, adapt, and build upon the work for non-commercial purposes, provided proper credit is given, and new creations are licensed under identical terms (Creative Commons, 2023).\nMoreover, the code used for the course’s construction was made publicly available on GitHub. Thus, R’s own use made the course reproducible and open, enabling others to review and expand it.\nThe course has high complexity as MOOC production required proper training and cognitive, technical, and social efforts. This was evident in the various stages necessary for the course’s construction: literature selection, content and material production, didactic proposal formulation to facilitate participant engagement, pilot application, and the technical knowledge of R, which required time and resources to acquire.\nRegarding demand, the course addresses a gap in Psychology and Humanities researcher training. As previously mentioned, existing R proposals for data analysis are directed toward Statistics and Data Science, bringing content to a complexity level that does not meet the targeted fields’ needs.\nFinally, the MOOC is considered highly innovative for Psychology, as there are no other courses on the subject in Brazil specifically addressing the area’s demands and being free. Additionally, replicability through open-source code and licenses as defined for the proposal is uncommon in the country.",

    "text": "17.1 This Nameless Time During a Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the onset of the novel coronavirus pandemic in Brazil and the necessary public health measures for social isolation to prevent contagion led to an immediate shift in daily life. This was notably evident in the uncertainty about the future and the fear of death, with political and social effects both at home and at work. As days passed in this new pandemic world, different levels of response to Covid-19 became clear. Factors related to class, territory, and income impacted social isolation and, consequently, the alarming death tolls. According to Cerqueira (2017), Brazil faced an unprecedented public health crisis, revealing multiple pandemics within a pandemic, such as the increase in lethal violence and the deepening of social inequalities.\nThis text reflects the experience of living through this historical time as individuals engaged in a graduate program at a public university, specifically a Professional Master’s program in Psychology and Public Policies in the interior of northeastern Brazil. It dares to think about the present, weaving ethical and political effects of the pandemic for the field of education, specifically in the face of the challenge of a remote and virtual classroom.\nDuring a teaching internship course in 2020, an audiovisual device titled “What Can the Pandemic Ask the Classroom?” was developed. It involved dialogues and exchanges between individuals from various territories engaged in education, art, and human rights policies in the state of Ceará. Through this, we wove meanings about training, experience, and learning in a pandemic world.\nConversation is a necessary sign for the development of this device, as isolation and excessive exposure to virtual screens produced social distancing and reduced spaces for dialogue and affective exchanges, even though we were continuously connected through screens, live streams, and remote classrooms. Therefore, we emphasize that this text expresses a polyphony of voices, mixing chronological times of the pandemic world. These connections range from the teaching internship course, with participation from the master’s student Thamila Santos, under the supervision of Professor Dr. Érica Atem Gonçalves de Araújo Costa, where the audiovisual device “What Can the Pandemic Ask the Classroom?” was created, to the present moment in 2021, in dialogue with master’s student Milena Assunção, a student from the second cohort of the master’s program, and an educational advisor in the municipality of Sobral. Her research project raises questions about thinking of education beyond institutions, productivity, and the successful numbers of Sobral’s education system.\nThus, our voices will meet during this writing, at different times, but under the perspective of a common plan to think about education and public policies, with the desire to continue building spaces for conversations; to enable meetings between the participants of the device “What Can the Pandemic Ask the Classroom?” and, later on, the more than 416 people who viewed the videos on social media. These videos became discussion topics in the Psychology classroom at Luciano Feijão College, in teacher training sessions at the Permanent Training School for Teaching and Educational Management (ESFAPEGE), and in training sessions with youth articulators from the Violence Prevention Projects Management Unit. It is, therefore, a gathering of many voices, attempting to understand this nameless time amid a pandemic.",

    "section": "17.2 School, Creation, and Training",
    "text": "17.2 School, Creation, and Training\n\nI walk around the world paying attention  To colors I don’t know the names of  - Adriana Calcanhotto, Esquadros, 1992\n\nThe world we know can be understood as an invention that becomes real in the act of creation. Inspired by the lyrics of Adriana Calcanhotto’s song in the epigraph, we see that attention is a muscle that can be exercised, as we walk around the world with fluctuating attention, sometimes focusing on one object, sometimes on another. For a sense of comfort and security, we take some elements, or almost all of them, of this created world as facts, as if these compositions had always existed. It is a paradox: we understand that something is an invention, yet, at the same time, it seems to have always existed—and therefore will always exist—as if there were a permanence with tones of essence.\nIn this sense, following this line of thought, we wish to problematize the school institution. This is because the school is a created place, marked by processes of subjectivation, by forces from temporal textures, which ultimately respond (or attempt to) to socio-historical anxieties. According to Masschelein and Simons (2019), the school “is a historical invention of the Greek polis and was an absolute attack on the privileges of the elites of an archaic order” (p. 105). Thus, the school, in the context of its initial fiction, positioned itself as resistance, a dialogical and democratic space.\nThe modern school institution, however, dates back to the 18th and 19th centuries. It is configured as an “attempt to dissipate renewal, radical potential” (Masschelein & Simons, 2019, p. 106), meaning this modern model diverges significantly from its Greek origins. Over time, through one of the lines that problematizes this space, the school has been described as a “normalizing, colonizing, and alienating machinery” (Masschelein & Simons, 2021, p. 19). In the Greek polis, the school was a space of confrontation, resistance, and dialogue. Conversely, the modern composition became a well-structured space, with its pedagogical steps and existences well defined. This movement points to an ideal of a rational, disciplined, hardworking subject that maintains the desired flow.\nHowever, the same authors remind us that even if this space seems like a well-centered and captured machinery, there is an unstable, provisional process in this organization. The school is always creating, always in a state of becoming, open and in process.\nThe question here is how this space is neither fixed nor stable. It is, above all, creation. The fact that the Greek origin was different from the modern one only reinforces the clue that educational practices and inventions are mutable (Brandão, 2007).\nTaking these historical nuances as a clue, we can understand that the school does not remain the same over time. It transforms, is contested, responds to socio-historical anxieties, and ultimately recreates itself. Understanding the school merely as a physical space that transmits a certain knowledge would be naive or even a way of denying how political this space is. The school is not and has never been a space apart from society. It is a place traversed by various debates, disputes, and perspectives that see different worlds. We thus have divergent desires for the same object.\nAffirming this social and political space of disputes implies understanding that it is not limited to a physical composition since the school is much more than walls and fences. Discussing the school institution inevitably means problematizing the education produced in this space and, more specifically, the subjects produced with the education developed there. According to Freire (1967), “there is no education outside human societies” (p. 35), meaning education, a human creation, can be understood as a set of practices that, while sharing a type of knowledge, also produce, subjectivize, and create a type of subject.\nThus, education is not configured as a practice detached from the world, an ahistorical action; on the contrary, “there can be no neutral, uncommitted, apolitical educational practice” (Freire, 2001, p. 21). From the first word, we affirm how what we produce crosses and forms us. Thus, educating is intervening, creating, and experiencing possibilities.\nThere is also another important notion: the school is not merely a place for knowledge transmission, where one teaches, and the other learns. We understand and advocate that education always occurs in relation. Affirming this, however, does not deny that there is an expected type of subject in education. Therefore, two aspects of education must be perceived: in educating, there is a relationship between the subjects involved in educational practices; and, being involved in these practices, there are processes of subjectivation, that is, the production of ways of existing.",

    "text": "17.3 The “Reinvention” of the Classroom: Imperatives and Urgencies\nDoor, rows of chairs, board, markers. These are recurring elements in classrooms. They are so common that they can be understood as essential for conducting a class. However, this idea was suspended at the beginning and throughout much of the Covid-19 pandemic. As it was no longer safe to be physically present, the physical classroom ceased to be a routine reality and became a target of precautions and recommendations.\nIn a matter of days, words like educational technologies, Google Classroom, video classes, WhatsApp, YouTube, and live streams were present in conversations, speeches, and training sessions. It was evident that creating a new way of teaching, experiencing the classroom, was more than necessary; it was urgent and demanded. These demands resonated in an array of tips, tutorials, information, and creative ways to make the “classroom floor” happen despite the physical absence. However, amid such effervescence, there was a pandemic.\nA pandemic that, in addition to all public health aspects, brought the worsening and intensification of social inequalities and vulnerabilities. Regarding the school institution, concerns such as food insecurity, violence, and child malnutrition became fundamental points in pedagogical-administrative discussions. Thus, alongside demands and incentives for pedagogical renewal, there were not only logistical questions about what to do with students who are outside this “connected education,” but also another pressing issue: how to think about online classes, hybrid teaching, technologies, if the target individuals of these actions do not have the minimum conditions for survival?\nIt is not that these concerns did not reach the school, the classroom. But their place was minimal, on the margins of actions. Then came a pandemic that touches various sectors and exposes inequalities, proving that the critical moment might be the same, but the ways of coping and impacts were very different. Inequalities were unmasked in a way that the place of major evaluations lost its prominence, its ultimate goal. How to think about exams, funding allocations, successful actions when the most significant outcry from the disadvantaged population touches basic needs? Hunger, death, extermination, performance. What is a grade compared to a hungry, homeless, unprotected child?\nWe must also not forget the teachers. Numerous calls arrived for the teaching profession, for example, openness to the new, resilience, creative classes. But did this come or just intensify? This new discourse, cloaked in beautiful, motivational words, reflects a deeper issue, touching on overload, devaluation, excessive demands, and the suffering resulting from the labor. Thus, to some extent, what happened was a kind of removal of a veil covering something that had long resonated.\nAmid the entire educational context, which is also social, the question arises: “What can the pandemic ask the classroom?” A broad question that touches not only the pedagogical but also the social, because all pedagogical action is social. But before that, we need to share how this is a question aiming at resonance, effects, and potentials, not merely framing culprits or even confronting practices, some more successful than others. We ask because we know and defend the understanding that problematizing moves, creates, and recreates effects. It is, therefore, to movement that this question relates.",

    "text": "17.4 “What Can the Pandemic Ask the Classroom?” as a Device for Encounter\nIf the pandemic world produced for us, students and teachers, a physical classroom in a state of interruption, as we walked through this new world with our masks, crowded hospitals, acute shortness of breath, and daily deaths, other sensitivities and affections had to enter the space we shared together with the classroom’s meaning. We bet that experiencing this formative space from the field of sensitivity is to propose paths where one can see, hear, think, and feel the world as a political, ethical, and aesthetic experience.\nTherefore, the idea of creating an artistic-political device of fictional encounter without screens with educators, students, and artists in the middle of a pandemic emerged. What to say about this experience that silences us? We were interested in listening to some trajectories crossed by the classroom in the contingencies of a global pandemic, but we knew the demands, the precariousness of work, the fallen bodies, the productivity.\nThe notion of the artistic-political device has been elaborated in dialogue with the studies of Rolnik (2009, 2019), which operates in the territory of art and politics, from the relationships with processes of subjectivation, culture, and creation. According to the author, the device has the capacity to “create the conditions for such practices to activate sensitive experiences in the present, necessarily different from those originally lived, but with equal critical density” (Rolnik, 2019, p. 97).\nFrom a trajectory of research interests crossed by politics and art, the possibility of doing something where these relationships could appear in the professional master’s program accompanied us. Thus, the possible path we found to respond to the provocations of the teaching internship course was to produce a device of encounter and listening from the field of sensitivity that would provoke voice, body, and narration of agents connected to education during the pandemic.\nThus, we present the experience of encountering eight educators from various fields of training, woven from the question: what can the pandemic ask the classroom? The choice of the eight participants was due to the affective and professional proximity with the researcher-student of the teaching internship course in 2020, Thamila Santos. The people invited to the conversation have intersections with public policies of education and human rights in Sobral. They are teachers from the municipal and private networks, artists, cultural producers, and researchers working in Sobral and Fortaleza. They are Jander Alcântara (theater artist and basic education arts teacher in Sobral), Clara Di Lernia (manager of permanent education at the Violence Prevention Projects Management Unit - UGP-PV, linked to the Human Rights Secretariat), Gisela Nóbrega (Fundamental I teacher at a private school in Sobral), Daiana Maciel (artist and psychologist at the Women’s Reference Center in Maranguape), Neirton Filho (musician, poet, and art educator), Dim Albuquerque (communicator and youth articulator at UGP-PV), Rômulo Silva (PhD student in sociology at UECE), and Léo Silva (peripheral photo-documentarian and cultural producer).\nThe diversity of voices and trajectories in the field of education interested us for building the device. The different existential territories regarding the classroom are necessary to problematize the political and ethical intersections that weave the formative space. Thus, we invited the participants to respond by audio to a question that would activate memories about training.\nWe bet on a hybrid format between audio and image languages, as audio invites listening to the subjects through the sound of their voices and the narration of their stories. Moreover, during the most critical period of social isolation, images were exhaustively used during video calls and live streams, which prompted us to think of another format of encounter.\nFrom listening to the responses made to the question “What can the pandemic ask the classroom?”, excerpts from the speeches were selected, and a fictional exchange of dialogues between the participants was created. All audios were listened to by the researcher, and, using a technique of cutting and selecting, commonly used in audiovisual media, elements that aroused problematization regarding the themes of training, memories, affections with the city, work, and the pandemic were selected.\nConsidering the possibility of not restricting the question to an explanatory or evaluative response, we wrote an invitation letter to inspire the participants to narrate other forms of processuality with their classrooms. We were interested in opening meanings for an experience of affections and the body. Thus, we found it appropriate to share the document as it was sent to the participants since the ways of doing interest us for the methodological and political texture of the paths taken, especially for the capacity to inspire and derive other practices from each reality.\n\n\n\nInvitation Letter\n\n\nIn the invitation letter, we described clues about the experimentation, aligned the objective of the intervention, and explained why we chose not to gather them in a virtual room for this collective dialogue. All in-person activities were suspended, and meetings, classes, work meetings, and leisure moments were mediated by exposure to virtual screens. This was part of our pandemic daily life, so the proposal of a fictional encounter through audios seemed more potent to open other channels of affection and problematization.\nUnderstanding fiction is not about the absence of truth but about creating possibilities for the invention of other realities, as poet Manoel de Barros brings to light when he says, “Everything I don’t invent is false.” Invention is not the absence of truth; it is, above all, the weaving of a path. Fiction, therefore, is an invention of worlds. It is a method for forging proximity between people from such different territories, living different pandemics, through the encounter with a common plan, with the experience of the classroom, through words, pauses, breaths, and sounds.\nThus, the idea was to create an invented dialogue that did not occur in person among the subjects, but which, through the intervention-composition of the researcher, produced a fictional encounter around the same question. The format was previously agreed upon with the participants, who authorized the editing of the audios to form a network of dialogues with everyone’s implications. Their responses served as inspiration for the editing and stitching of a polyphonic, diverse, ethical, and propositional conversation about training policies in pandemic contexts.\nThe conception of this artistic-political device draws inspiration from cartography, in the studies of authors who intersect between the field of subjectivation politics and art, such as Rolnik (2016) and Kastrup (2004), who forge dialogues with the field of sensitivity as a research method.\nWith cartography, we perceive and create worlds and research from the idea of composition. As Kastrup and Passos (2016) write, composition is on the plane of forces and affections, it refers to a politics, an ethos, and a commitment to creating a common and heterogeneous world. In the idea of composition, we experience a co-engenderment between researcher and field, which calls the trajectories and limits of the researcher.\nIn this sense, the encounters among the participants were arranged as a composition. In the sound editing studio, the researcher drew lines between the responses, producing new material from that encounter of voices. This culminated in the final version of an audiovisual material, engendered with video images produced by the researcher of the city of Sobral during the pandemic, creating a way to compose with the images other visualities of the city and the pandemic time.\nThus, this conversation was invented to bring educators together in a time of deep desertification like the pandemic, an experience of not promptly answering questions but lingering in them, observing which cracks or beams of light emerge from their fissures.",

    "text": "17.5 A Way to Conclude or an Affirmation in Desert Times\nBuilding a shared path, bringing a polyphony of voices to think about the classroom, speaks of a practice that concerns the historical and relational aspects that traverse this space; of perceiving that the school is an invented creation that constantly recreates itself, that the classroom is not immutable, fixed. On the contrary, we share that this space was one way, and during the beginning of the pandemic, it had to be another, and this will continue to happen, as we do not have given facts but phenomena created and constructed collectively.\nThe affirmative question highlighted by sharing the device “What Can the Pandemic Ask the Classroom?” is that we can produce an exercise of invention in the field of art, politics, and education that serves as a vital alternative to the desertification of pandemic times and the brutalization of education. The challenge seems to be creating something with people, using art to do it with them, with fragments of conversations, sounds, with images that can be evoked.\nThe ethical horizon of this material is the possibility of conversations with more people, as already happened in some spaces, such as the dissemination of the videos on social media, screening and discussion of the video with the youth articulators group of the Violence Prevention Projects Management Unit (UGP-PV), in a teacher training class at the Permanent Training School for Teaching and Educational Management of Sobral, and with a psychology class at Luciano Feijão College (FLF).\nIn this perspective, we highlight some effects already produced through the circulation of this tool in the world, such as an approach with training groups in the municipality of Sobral, whose exchange produced discussions to think about education and training in pandemic contexts. We also highlight an approach with the youth articulators group working in vulnerable territories in Sobral. The videos were shown during the workers’ permanent education processes and enabled discussions about a non-institutionalized school and the impacts of learning in the pandemic in situations of social inequalities.\nIn this sense, we hope it continues to be used, adapted, made available, and continues to produce effects of problematization and encounter. We hope it serves as a material that is not only a reference for the field of art but also for the field of education, especially because it is a technical product easily replicable due to its virtual accessibility and audiovisual format.\nWe are interested, in the artistic-political field, in the defense of art as politics, as an announcement of a sensitive sphere in the micro-policies of education. Therefore, this artistic-political device has a character that not only figures in the field of macro-politics but also in the field of micro-politics, aiming to catalyze conversations with and among education agents to produce horizons for classrooms that are more sonorous, narrative, and grounded in the invention of possible worlds.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "18.1 In the Beginning, There Was the Draft\nCurrently, there are approximately 7,139 languages spoken around the world (Ethnologue, 2016), 7,139 different ways to express, share information, describe, write, and inscribe oneself in the world. We begin by talking about languages, even though this is not a chapter about that topic, but rather about a way of inscribing oneself in the world that transcends the standard written language typical of academia. As Duarte Júnior (2000) proposes, we must dare within academia, bringing new languages to dialogue with everyday life.\nLanguage, in itself, expresses the variety we have as human beings. If our history is built through this diversity, why deny it precisely when we talk about science and education? More than that, as a space for dialogue and encounter, especially through public access policies, we cannot think of universities without thinking of difference. So, why not create new contours within the university?\nFor the research project “‘Music is Just a Seed’: Art and Education as a Tool for Empowerment for Marginalized Youth,” we initially planned the organization and implementation of art workshops aimed at raising awareness of social issues common to socially vulnerable youth, users of the Social Assistance Reference Center (CRAS) in the city of Reriutaba/CE, through discussions about music, dance, poetry, etc. The workshops were to be developed within the Service for Coexistence and Strengthening of Bonds (SCFV) at CRAS Amanaiara, where the researcher worked as a psychologist. The intention was to observe how art could impact these youths to develop a sense of empowerment and social transformation.\nHowever, life has its own course. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, group workshops became unfeasible. Even considering a virtual workshop, access barriers emerged, as many target youth did not have cell phones or internet access at home. Thus, the virtual option would result in exclusion rather than inclusion, contrary to the workshops’ goal.\nTherefore, amid research orientation dialogues, the production of a booklet or a comic book (HQ) was discussed as a facilitation tool for working on topics relevant to Brazilian youth’s daily lives (racism, sexuality, gender, violence, family relationships, and other affective relationships), which are often difficult to discuss due to the density and complexity of these topics. The material would support professionals working with youth, offering opportunities for discussion on various topics and allowing youth to express themselves through art. This art could manifest in the tool through format, content, or both via illustration, music, and design.\nWe opted for the second option, not only for the appeal to the youth language that the HQ would provide, being more accepted by CRAS users, but also for the possibilities considered here of connecting with these youths’ lives through a narrative that dialogues with the experiences common to peripheral youth, often lacking relevant space in the media. The HQ could bring to the forefront issues that Brazilian youth, especially those from the peripheries, face daily, such as gender, race, and class issues, often silenced and invisible as they do not appear in mainstream media or only as secondary issues.\nThus, the HQ takes shape, constructing the narrative, characters, and spaces that resemble real stories since the researcher creates it from work experience at CRAS with the youths assisted by the institution. The traits are borrowed from reality and transcribed into a storyline that brings these youths from the background to the forefront, allowing a new perspective on a reality written daily in the lives of Brazilian youth.",

Considering that our interaction with artifacts is laden with judgments, values, and beliefs from previous experiences, memories, and indirectly obtained information (Cardoso, 2013), it was crucial that the production did not depart from the researcher’s position as a CRAS reference technician in his experience within the institution.\nWithin CRAS, there was an opportunity to actively participate with social counselors in activities with the SCFV youth, where exchanges, dialogues, and conversation circles took place. Experience showed that in these dialogues, we could get to know part of the youths’ perspective on their surroundings and identify issues that brought them together. From the HQ proposition by the research, the researcher inhabited these spaces of speech and listening attentively to what could compose the storyline of ‘We.’ The concern was to create a story pertinent and consistent with that youth’s perspective, addressing the emerging issues with new representations that ensured the youth’s representation in the main characters without giving the impression of exposing their privacy.\nThus, the work ethically committed to creating characters with common stories based on the youths’ experiences, without using their statements literally or exposing them. This was extended by the researcher’s own youth experience and observation of other everyday stories found in the media, social networks, and daily life, not solely focusing on CRAS youths but articulating them with different Brazilian youths.\nConsequently, the characters’ outlines reflect the various realities found among Brazilian youth, with real, harsh, and fun stories converted into a narrative with one foot in reality and the other in fiction. This led to the creation of Liz, Caiubi, Luke, Julia, and Oliver, carrying marks daily inscribed on real people surviving the barbarism of neoliberalism (Abramo, 2008). These barbarisms result from experiencing violence mainly related to stigmatization of marginalized places, whether concrete or not, such as racism, homophobia, sexism, and violence in social relations, both in intrafamilial spaces and public spaces, such as schools.\nCaiubi is a bisexual youth of indigenous descent who hides both traits at school because he feels the need to prove his masculinity, as he sees himself as “the man of the house” since his father’s abandonment. He dates Oliver, a gay teenager who recently moved to a new city and school due to his mother’s job change. Oliver is best friends with Liz, a proud black, plus-sized young woman who hides trauma caused by racism and fatphobia behind humor. Upon arriving at school, Liz and Oliver meet Luke, a transgender youth who has recently started his transition process and has not found the courage to tell his mother, fearing expulsion from home. Luke is also new at school and, upon arrival, meets Julia, a white teenager who takes feminism seriously but from a perspective that does not consider race and class issues, leading to clashes with Liz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Oliver\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Caiubi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Liz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Julia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Luke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.2: Characters\n\n\n\nThese youths end up in the same group for a Portuguese assignment. However, their union as a group only emerges through sharing their differences, highlighting points of convergence and divergence but, above all, support. From the point where “they” transform into “we,” the creation of bonds allows support beyond the school experience; the “we” opens up the idea of community.\nThus, both the characters and the relationships among them allow access to different relevant discussions in the youth’s daily lives. Liz and Julia present issues about feminism, racism, aesthetics, and mental illness experienced through social exclusion or family toxicity. Moreover, although not directly addressed, their relationship also touches on self-harm and depression.\nIn turn, the relationship between Oliver, Caiubi, and Luke addresses masculinity, homoaffective relationships, sexuality, and gender issues, opening up thoughts on both transgender identity and gender performance associated with masculinity and its power positions. Additionally, this encompasses violence stemming from homophobia and sexism.\nFurthermore, in the HQ, these issues appear not only in discussions among the youths, but secondary roles also present power dynamics. For example, when teacher Bel invites the youths to bring their daily lives into the classroom through an activity for a second grade, this breaks the barrier between school and external experiences. Another element is the principal’s character, who occupies a silencing position towards the youths, demonstrating a lack of interest in their relationships, conflicts, and emotions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.3: Dialogue between teacher and principal\n\n\n\nAnother noteworthy aspect is the characterization of primary and secondary characters, as well as spaces, considering regional and national representation. This choice materializes in the HQ through language, the use of neologisms, the predominantly non-white primary and secondary characters, and the presence of bars—common marks in our public objects and buildings—in the physical structure of public schools. Thus, it is through presenting the perceived reality that the boundaries of the real experience of Brazilian youths, specifically peripheral youths, and fantasy are blurred, allowing pathways for transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18.4: Table and characters\n\n\n\nTo build knowledge and transform action into revolution, it is necessary to understand the colors the listener uses to paint the world so that we can present new paintings, techniques, and colors (Freire, 2019), thereby joining forces for the radical transformation of social oppressions that persist. As Preciado (2020) states, “for the subaltern, speaking is not simply resisting the violence of hegemonic performativity. It is, above all, imagining dissident theaters where it is possible to produce a new performative force” (p. 131).\nFerreira (2010) notes that art is a specific way of building knowledge, an inventive force that recreates life. Therefore, fantasy broadens our field of vision and creates tools and mechanisms for structural societal change. Creativity allows us to transform our reality, as imagination enables us to trace new routes that impact concrete reality, making it suitable for the space of education and politics (Freire & Shor, 1986). This engagement in making that ties the imaginative to concrete reality points to the social revolution of everyday know-how.",

    "section": "18.3 “Who Tells a Tale Adds a Point”: Do All Points Count?",
    "text": "18.3 “Who Tells a Tale Adds a Point”: Do All Points Count?\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie (2019), in her talk about the danger of a single story, discusses the impact of telling stories about a group or people, constructing stigmas that relegate subjects to inferior or dangerous positions based on how, when, by whom, and how much they are told. This repeats itself in our history and remains present today, as observed in the construction of villains and heroes by the national media.\nAdding to Adichie’s perspective (2019), thinking about stories is thinking about power. As Almeida (2015) says, recalling Walter Benjamin, the official, told history is the history of the victors. Wars are told from the perspective of those who win, not those who are defeated, thus legitimizing the lens that views history from the perspective of those in power. Having the power to narrate is having political power. In Boal’s words (2009): “The semantic struggle is a struggle for power” (p. 70). This daily reproduction is rooted in our form of societal construction. When we think about health, education, social relations, and public policies, we notice they are always intertwined with the perspective of those with more power, as they are the ones who construct them. However, their maintenance thrives on the openness they find in our reproduction of this viewpoint in our actions, values, and thoughts.\nTherefore, it is undeniable the potency of creating spaces for these “unofficial” narrators to resist the hegemonic speech and hack the processes of social construction, in which, practically, we are all implicated. Thus, creating spaces for listening and speaking is opening fertile ground for new meaning productions and transforming not only individuals but also collectives—and society—through the power of the narrator who metamorphoses into different voices. A narration that is not complete, as that would be unfeasible, but prismatic, meaning it does not hierarchize vertically nor order horizontally but intersects.\nJoice Berth (2019) addresses this issue when talking about silencing, using the term “pernicious ignorance,” which refers to bad-faith ignorance that acts violently by hindering or denying access to cultural and intellectual production of historically oppressed groups. “This ignorance arises from the dominant classes perpetuating inequalities and fighting against losing the hegemony of the single discourse” (Berth, 2019, p. 58).\nThus, history and culture, although collectively constructed, are presented only from the dominant group’s perspective. Meanwhile, the other participants in this construction, essential actors in the cultural construction of the country, have their narratives treated as exotic and only find openness at specific historical points, almost as if asking for permission. This can be seen in presenting indigenous or original populations, Afro-Brazilian, and originally Oriental cultures. Berth (2019) also calls this epistemic violence, as it refers to the transmission and production of knowledge, something that also becomes an issue for Preciado (2020), who, during the Flip festival, challenges us to consider the importance and possibility of creating a multiaxial epistemology capable of dealing with the world’s plurality.\nReturning to Preciado, we find a path to his question by stating that “what Benjamin invites us to do is write history from the perspective of the vanquished. Only through this inverted rewriting will it be possible to interrupt the repetition of oppression” (Preciado, 2020, p. 118). It is in the profanation of historical tradition that we can rewrite society alongside the excluded and silenced. With them, we can (re)learn new paths for science, education, and public policies.\nThis path is where the HQ “We” treads and proposes to be a tool for transformation. Although the story is not written and manually produced by the CRAS youths, the storyline brings experiences and realities close to these youths, based on an attentive observation and listening to their lives, using their language and everyday settings. In this sense, the work presents itself as an invitation to speak. It invites the subject, through illustrated theatricality, to look at themselves and their community and understand that their stories deserve attention and written records. It is an invitation to listen to new stories and, why not, to construct new stories from a new perspective.\nThis process is not distant from educational practice. According to Silva (2000), the act of educating is a way of inscribing difference in the world that brings life by preventing its eternal reproduction. In this measure, education is understood beyond its formal dimension, as differentiation and identification processes transcend the school space, occurring in various places, including CRAS.\nAs Brazil’s education patron Paulo Freire (2019) states:\n\nIf it were clear to us that we learned to understand teaching as possible, we would easily understand the importance of informal experiences in the streets, squares, at work, in school classrooms, in playgrounds, where various gestures of students, administrative staff, and teachers intersect full of meaning (pp. 44-45).\n\nThus, we understand that education goes far beyond repetitions and training for assessment responses. Education involves affection, relationships, autonomy, and power, something that often goes unnoticed by most of us during our formative process throughout life. It is not uncommon to see education through a superficial prism, reducing it to technical training and market logic, even though its fundamental role in citizenship formation is marked in official documents about education (Severiano, 2021).\nTherefore, new ways of doing education inside and outside classrooms are essential, education built in everyday life, in the “poetry of daily life,” as seen in the HQ, contrasting with rigid, harsh education that separates the place of science from the place of fun. Thus, writing with voice and body, color, and history is relevant for education and public policies. As Hooks (2020) states, if we act as if history does not matter or impact us, we risk erasing ourselves. By erasing our bodies in favor of directive and objective knowledge and practice, we erase our social differences and their impacts on our lives under a false assumption of neutrality, which is convenient for neoliberal logic, perpetuating privileges.\nNot far from this, public policies are impacted by the reality of the neoliberal society in which they exist, where policy formulation and management face a struggle against the guarantee of social rights. As Teixeira (2009) states:\n\nFormulating social policies in capitalism, and more so in the context of neoliberalism, is facing powerful social forces always fighting to ensure the consolidation of their interests and privileges in the State, which invest against social rights, especially those with a redistributive perspective. (p. 8)\n\nThus, decision-making positions and deliberation tend to be influenced by market desires over the social needs of the impoverished population. This marks the formulation of public policies in Brazil throughout its history, encountering bottlenecks in both the architecture of democratic participation in policy formulation and the state’s authoritarian view of citizens (Teixeira, 2009).\nIn this false participation or lack of awareness of the issues affecting individuals impacted by public policies, exclusion occurs through inclusion, whereby the individual assisted by public policies receives a monochromatic logic that considers a generic subject, based on a distant, objective view of people unrelated to those concretely served. As a result, the policy sometimes loses its meaning because it does not make sense to the users.\nIf public policies lack democratic participation, this extends throughout, including its tools. When establishing the possibility of creating tools from other forms of observing the experience in their spaces, giving voice and opportunities to users and the creative potential of professionals involved in institutions, policy reconstruction can be considered.\nTherefore, the HQ as a tool for public policy produced by a CRAS technician embodies both a strength and a limitation. This is because the research field for its creation is present directly due to the professional experience with youths and personal experience as an individual who experienced vulnerability outside the norm. However, the story was not passed through the filter of these CRAS-assisted youths due to the public health circumstances posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This propels the need for subsequent research focused on analyzing the perception of impacts and meanings produced by the story and characters on peripheral youths and, based on findings, adjusting the HQ.\nNonetheless, this necessity does not obscure the potential of this tool within public policies when discussing voice and history recovery. As Adichie (2019) states, “stories have been used to dispossess and malign, but they can also be used to empower and humanize. They can break a people’s dignity, but they can also repair that broken dignity” (p. 16).\nThe HQ narrative thus presents itself as a space for creating bonds through dialogue, something inherent to artistic expression. This, as a tool for building bonds, acts from the expression of subjects’ individuality, allowing connection points and the potential to develop a sense of belonging and sociability (O’Neill, 2015).\nAdditionally, if art welcomes multiplicity through polysemy, playing with the obvious, and expanding boundaries (Gomes, 2015, p. 109), it is through the HQ story that the complexity of youth experiences, so plural, is presented, creating different openings for identification with future readers who can insert themselves into the story and, through its ink, perceive new ways to recolor reality by turning to their own world.\nThrough the subjectivity involved in constructing the story, readers can recognize themselves, not just as spectators but as those protagonists, borrowing the characters’ traits and colors in “We.” Thus, the We extends beyond the story’s characters, reaching all those who participate in the narrative through identificatory traits. This proximity opens space for liberating one’s voice, essential for considering empowerment. In “Raising the Voice,” Bell Hooks (2019) states that\n\nFor the oppressed, the colonized, the exploited, and those who stand and fight alongside, an act of defiance that heals, that enables new life and growth. This act of speaking, of “raising the voice,” is not a mere gesture of empty words: it is an expression of our transition from object to subject – The voice liberates. (p. 29)\n\nThe voice inscribes us in the world, allowing us to oppose the demands of another. In other words, raising the voice is a form of emancipation aiming at empowerment, understood here as necessarily linked to the collective dimension, as “critical consciousness is an inseparable condition of empowerment” (Berth, 2018, p. 53). The HQ follows its path without losing sight of this collective condition, as it is through moments of exchange and dialogue between characters that individualism is broken through sharing pains, doubts, and joys previously enclosed in each individual’s experience.\nThrough encounters and conversations, convergence and divergence points emerge, initiating the construction of a collective, a “we.” From this encounter, previously solitary and silent issues can be redrawn with the support acquired in building bonds.\nFostering spaces for dialogue within public policies, using art as a mediator, contributes to realizing effective citizenship and social reconstruction by traditionally marginalized actors. Through collective experience exchanges, it becomes evident that various existing systems of domination are not the only possible way (Berth, 2018). Instead, we can jointly produce ways to confront them with our communities.\nCreativity is essential in this process, whether for its utopian character (Duarte Junior, 1995) or its openness to difference. Proposing a tool marked by art to mediate experience exchanges distances us (although it cannot eliminate the danger entirely) from conducting actions in a merely technical way, which, by its impersonal nature, homogenizes people by not recognizing their plurality.\nConsequently, actions in public policies that intertwine art and social themes tend to foster empowerment by enabling the elaboration of subjective issues, critical thinking about the daily life and experiences of the individuals involved. By promoting creative environments, they strengthen individuals and their groups, generating spaces where the individual can take charge of their story, tell it, and rework it.",

    "section": "18.4 Possible Ways to Use It:",
    "text": "18.4 Possible Ways to Use It:\nAs a public policy tool, the HQ is not limited to social assistance policies. Its diversity allows it to circulate through different policies: culture, by considering art’s role in youth construction; education, by walking through the idea of education happening inside and outside the classroom; health, by shedding light on the mental health impacts of social exclusion through racism and body relations. In short, the work can be used in any space where work with socially vulnerable youth is developed around different themes, beyond those exposed here.\nFor example, we invite readers to imagine a CRAS or school professional wanting to address discussions about social exclusions experienced daily. Initially, the comic book can be handed out to each youth for collective or individual reading.\nFollowing the reading, a conversation circle is promoted, where youths can share what touched them during the material reading, what impacted them, what resonated with their realities, and what, although distant, seemed interesting. In the circle, the idea is to open space for speaking and listening, mainly among the youths, so they can perceive congruence points where the stories touched the same place. It is also interesting to observe characters of identification and the reasons for this, as it allows learning more about the youths and their interests, enabling future actions.\nAnother important point in the circle is for the professional to understand where the youths are coming from, what violence they have experienced, and how aware they seem to be of it. It is essential for public policy professionals to be aware of positions of privilege and inequality to guide their actions. Matthews (2015) identifies three main consequences for educators who disregard privilege in their work: marginalization, exclusion, and “colonized consciousness.” Here, it is believed that these effects extend to other public policy actions, where exclusion and marginalization occur by erasing or silencing the lived and cultural production of groups. Thus, their interests are not explored, potentially affecting their desire to participate in spaces (Matthews, 2015).\nMoreover, this disinterest in these groups’ work can develop a notion of valuing only a particular culture related to privileged groups, to the detriment of their own, assuming an attitude of subordination and affirmation of inferiority by being outside this superior culture, inferiorizing themselves in identificatory and unconscious, cultural, and social processes, understanding themselves as part of an inferior group (Berth, 2019; Matthews, 2015).\nTherefore, it is important for public policy professionals to reflect on the notion of privilege and oppression and, more than that, to perceive in their daily lives the relationships around them and the behaviors reproduced by themselves and public policy actors. Here is another possible use: the HQ can serve as a tool to problematize these issues with public policy professionals and youths.\nAnother alternative is, from the conversation circle, to encourage youths to seek out these characters in real life, inviting them to bring stories that could belong to these characters to the space. These could be personal stories of the participating youths, friends, family members, or distant individuals, like artists. The idea is to show that those stories happen in real life and deserve to be told, that they have value. Additionally, this opens the door to authorship and representing one’s own story.\nOther possible uses can also be listed, such as creating sketches or other forms of performance about the story. Another option would be for youths to write stories about other fictional youths in the city where the HQ story takes place, in the shown spaces, interacting with the original characters, crossing paths with them at school, CRAS, streets, or neighborhood. Thus, the HQ unfolds into a space for reconstructing the story by other people, voices, and perspectives.\nIt is worth highlighting that in these activities, it is interesting for the mediator or facilitator to participate actively, just like the youths, establishing a horizontal relationship in response to the youths’ openness, demonstrating the professional’s interest in establishing a bond not characterized by hierarchy. It is always clear: we cannot transform the world without being with it; acting together gives corporeality to the example and idea (Freire, 2019).\nFinally, it is relevant to explain that there are not only these ways of using the material. Limiting its use would be contradictory, given that we start from the idea that there is no single way to tell or make stories. Thus, here we explicitly wish for responsible and free use of the material in the most diverse activities readers engage in. We hope that in the end, it is just the beginning of the path to a recognition and social transformation process for people in their different ways of existing with the world.",

    "text": "18.5 Conclusion Processing…\nReturning from the beginning, we can understand the importance of language in our connection with ourselves and the space we live in, in its possibility of transforming reality by how we tell and make history and art. In its unfolding, we are touched by it; we can create identification, and breaches for the entry of previously erased actors. As Hooks (2020) states, it is through language that “we, marginalized and oppressed people, try to rescue ourselves and our experiences through language” (p. 233).\nCreating a comic book as a tool for public policy work within a public university is breaking with a hegemonic practice that prioritizes a false division between scientific and artistic practice when both enrich each other in their joint practice. It is understanding the division created between “mind and body,” which erases subjects and the obstacles involving their social place, and reconciling with sensitivity and other subjects with whom we build society (Gomes, 2015; Hooks, 2020).\nBeyond that, it creates a practical tool for public policies that not only aims to give space to peripheral youths’ voices but starts from this premise. Thus, using the HQ by public policy professionals contributes to transformative practice, highlighting often ignored but significant experiences, giving youths the chance to see themselves in the characters’ speeches, attitudes, and exchanges.\nCreating the HQ implied a broader professional practice, questioning the work space and how it is executed and dictated within public policies. This points to the relevance of alternative technical production for achieving professional master’s objectives. Through research, the researcher can look at their professional experience and act based on it, bringing new action possibilities attentive to meanings. The research also highlights the importance of valuing public policy technicians in their work with vulnerable populations, as this is still a function suffering from professional precariousness, directly affecting services.\nFinally, it is hoped that the research does not end here and that it and its resulting fruits promote, increasingly, spaces for exchanges and creation in public policies, where invisible stories find a place to raise their voices. Furthermore, it is hoped that public policies can reinvent themselves for social transformation through democratic means, through many hands, voices, and “we.”",

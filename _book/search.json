    "text": "Introduction\nCommenting on the construction of this book means discussing a technical production. According to the latest CAPES classification (hemerly2019producao--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?), a publishing product is defined as resulting from “the processes of editing and publishing fiction and non-fiction works. It includes planning and executing, intellectually and graphically, books, encyclopedias, preparing texts, illustrations, layout, etc., linked to the Program (projects, lines, students/graduates)” (p. 41). Broadly speaking, this is what we did, and by this definition, we are well-aligned.\nThat said, it is necessary to state that producing this book was a way to free ourselves from some constraints, although we are still bound to another, not by choice, but by an institutional framework that we can at least qualify as questionable. We will return to this particular institutional constraint later.\nThe first constraint we freed ourselves from by constructing this book was that of publishers. In an analog world, where books needed to be printed and distributed for their content to be accessed, publishers played a significant role. Maintaining the necessary infrastructure for a book to go from someone’s mind to the reader was expensive, and most people who wanted to publish something could not afford the required resources. If this is true, on the other hand, the decision about what the public should read was concentrated in the hands of a few companies, and what dictated this decision was the potential commercial return of a work. There was, therefore, an oligopoly on thought.\nThis same logic applies to any other form of expression that depended on analog means and structures to be created and distributed: music, films, news, etc. However, today we live in a world where the production and transmission of information are digital. Thus, just as it is no longer necessary to have a soundboard to record or a vinyl record to materialize a phonogram, printed paper is dispensable (which does not mean it has no value). It is also no longer necessary to have a truck transporting tons of books back and forth for people to access them.\nDespite this liberation, this story, which is still ongoing, so far, does not seem to have a happy ending. Capitalism is like the Borg: it always finds a way to adapt and keeps insisting that resistance is futile. In the new world of the internet, the oligopoly of analog production and distribution by publishers, record companies, radio, and TV was replaced by that of large technology companies through streaming platforms, whether video, audio, or even books. Yes, we can create and distribute books, music, and news without intermediaries, but only those linked to the most well-known transmission platforms have a chance to appear and stand out, with rare exceptions.\nDespite this setback, the initial premise, that it is possible to create and distribute without intermediaries, is valid, can be explored, and is what we did. In this context, this book was developed with free and open-source software called Quarto, which is platform-agnostic. In our case, R and R Studio were the tools used to mediate our relationship with the documents and other files we created. Furthermore, all the code used for the book’s production is publicly available on GitHub.\nIn this new form of digital organization, we are also free from the linearity imposed by the analog medium. When we used a cassette tape, to get to the song we wanted to hear, we had to fast-forward to the point where it was. If we were watching a TV show and needed to go to the bathroom for a few moments, we would miss that crucial moment of the series where the entire plot was revealed. Today, we can even pause a live TV broadcast and return later.\nThus, in a book, we had a series of printed words and pictures and would go from page to page to where we wanted. Visually impaired people needed a Braille version to access the material autonomously. In digital versions, the book does not need to have only words or pictures, and they do not have a concrete form. In this sense, concerning visual impairment, screen readers are common and increasingly accurate, which, as long as the material is properly organized, allows it to be accessed by blind or low-vision people. Even the figures, if audio-described (and in our case, they are), can be “read.”\nIn this context, any of the chapters of this book can be accessed with a click, and there is a search tool to find terms or concepts one wishes to retrieve. Since we do not only need to have words, we can, for example, place videos wherever we wish and blocks for people to execute R codes. Here are some examples of how the possibility of bringing together various media in a single space was utilized in this production:\nThese are examples of what can be done, and as researchers better understand these intersection possibilities, much more can be articulated. There is a universe of creativity to be explored.\nThe third constraint does not depend solely on technological means to be freed from. It depends on a political struggle to rethink scientific production in Brazil, especially the ways of evaluating graduate programs, granting scholarships, and funding researchers. I have heard from more than one sensible voice that Einstein would never have an approved project in Brazil. Over the years, a neoliberal managerial logic has taken over Brazilian education at all levels and seems to have taken root in evaluation mechanisms.\nThe formula is very similar to the financialization that has taken over companies: only the quarterly profit for dividend distribution and to increase managers’ bonuses matters. Immediate profitability must come at any cost, even if it means making cuts that will take away innovation possibilities and, in the long run, render the company uncompetitive in the market.\nIn graduate studies, what we see is: publish massively, even if they are absolutely irrelevant products, but that score points in the miraculously elaborated evaluation tables. The more you do this, the more access to resources and “prestige in the field” you will have, to perhaps someday do what you truly believe needs to be done.\nObviously, we are not saying that all production is irrelevant; there are numerous innovations and discoveries that emerge amidst this perverse logic, but the caricature serves to show the path this model leads us down. With this caveat made, in the long run, it is necessary to denounce that this scoring table model applied to graduate studies can make scientific production voluminous but without any impact, whether in basic science, where we simply want to understand how the universe works, or in the attempt to solve the numerous problems the country faces.\nThis model already has by-products: the trade in participation in collection books, whose advertisements claim to be “compliant with Qualis CAPES,” and perhaps even more ethically questionable, the sale of co-authorship in chapters. If the game is to score points, what’s the problem with selling points to those who want or need them? The logic is simple: pay, publish, and score.\nAnd what do we do? We invent a pretty name to avoid going to the root of the problem: they are “predatory” publishers and journals. We will make endless lists to put them on our academic vanity bonfire, proclaim to the four winds that these practices need to be combated, and continue avoiding the discussion that really matters, which is to ask ourselves why the evaluation has this purely quantitative character based on questionable scoring criteria. There are ‘qualitative’ elements in the evaluation forms, but, in the end, it is the volume of “well-scored” production that counts, and the competition between programs is the basis of the evaluation system.\nIn this sense, we will not criticize the people who organize and make money from this trade, even if the practice is morally questionable (tell us something in capitalism that isn’t?), nor the people who participate in it, because they are not the cause of the problem but the most obvious consequence of the model we are questioning. We will not criticize, but we have to ask ourselves: does anyone believe in the relevance of most of the “knowledge” generated in this academic fruit market? And this market arises from the managerial model that needs to create scoring tables to say who is more or who is less in this four-yearly ranking of graduate programs.\nA small addendum to show how this spreads throughout Brazilian education. Something similar happens in basic education when looking at large-scale assessments, a U.S. proposal that has already proven flawed there, but which is still treated with deference here due to the enormous influence that private foundations linked to large corporate groups have on educational policies. Several municipalities display advertisements showing the scores that municipalities and schools obtained in the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB). Political opponents will accuse managers of fraud to get the scores, but in many cases, there is no fraud in the sense they are accusing.\nThe fraud lies in treating education as training children to solve Portuguese and math tests, the only subjects evaluated. This leads to what is called curriculum narrowing (gesqui2015estreitamento--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?; rubio2020avaliacao--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?), where all other subjects are relegated to second place. There are cases where history, geography, and any other subject teachers are pressured to teach the topics that will be covered in external assessments and abandon their content. If we think about it, even Portuguese and math are sidelined because they themselves do not matter, but rather the children’s ability to solve the tests. Critical thinking, citizenship, scientific education, for what? What I need is to advertise how high the municipality’s score was.\nTranslating this statement to graduate studies: cutting-edge scientific production, solving the country’s problems, making discoveries about the universe, for what? What I need is to score, score, and score to reach the Olympus of grade 7. In both cases, what has this brought positive to society? Nobody cares because what is at stake is the quarterly result to distribute dividends to shareholders and give bonuses to managers. In this logic, the long term is for those who like to philosophize and not for those who like to make money or score.\nHere, another addendum: will we criticize those who play the game as it is set? Never! People are trying to survive in this jungle of competition that this evaluation model has created and are workers with precarious working conditions who, in the midst of all this, try to do something relevant for the world. What we can do is invite them to reflection and engagement in the struggle for better working conditions, which involves a profound change in how scientific production is evaluated in Brazil. Did you think we ourselves would abandon this game because there is no way? You thought wrong…! The first thing capitalism condemns us to is fatalism, and we will not surrender to it.\nAs we said before, we purposely caricature the path of scientific irrelevance to which this model leads, but we recognize the struggle of teachers and researchers to produce high-level knowledge in a country that treats science and technology as something subordinate. If here we make the denunciation, it is not against the workers, but against the capitalist system that intertwined its financial logic in the management and evaluation of graduate studies and proclaims the end of history, as if nothing else were possible beyond the deepening of this perverse model.",

    "text": "Introduction\nThis chapter aims to report the experiences of creating podcasts, as communication products, by VIESES: Group of Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation, between 2020 and 2021, as strategies for dialogical production and sharing knowledge about Psychology, human rights, and contemporary socio-psychological processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This laboratory is part of the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought several challenges to the academic activities of VIESES, which, since its creation, occurred through the insertion and joint composition in peripheral territories of Fortaleza. With the implementation of emergency remote activities at UFC to ensure physical distancing for the prevention of COVID-19 infections, it was necessary to reinvent formative strategies that maintained the dialogical ethos of our knowledge production in Psychology, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels (Barros et al., 2023).\nThe experiences of creating 4 podcasts by VIESES within this context will be reported: Presentemente, #TraçandoVáriosPlanos, Artes Insurgentes, and Café da Tarde. The goal of these initiatives was for knowledge production, in a scenario of extreme fragility in guaranteeing rights, to act politically for visibility, articulation, and production of other channels of listening to an insurgent psychology (Barros et al., 2019). The aim was, above all, to act against the historical-social logics of oppression, aggravated by the pandemic context, and to serve as a tool that blurs hegemonic boundaries of knowledge construction, using cybernetic tools to overcome these challenges.",

    "text": "Presentemente Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe Presentemente podcast, whose name is inspired by the song “Sujeito de Sorte” by singer Belchior, was created in 2020 with the aim of pluralizing and resonating discussions about the present from critical and diverse perspectives on topics pertinent to the field of human rights, valuing practices of resistance and ways of staying “sane, safe, and strong.” The project was made possible by a VIESES team composed of undergraduate students and a faculty advisor, involving topic selection, contacting guests1, script creation, editing, posting episodes on podcast aggregators, and promoting artwork on social media. The discussions in each episode are conducted by people affected in various ways by the topic, either from experience in social movements, academic productions, or life experiences, aiming to diversify the debates and elucidate various perspectives. Each episode, averaging 50 minutes, was released biweekly on Thursdays between July and October 2020. The first season of the podcast consists of six episodes. The titles covered, in order of publication, were: “Hatred and Cancellation Today,” “Racism and Anti-Racist Struggle,” “Peripheries and Poetic Re-Existences,” “LGBTQIA+ Lives and LGBTFOBIA,” and “Childhoods in Brazil.” The season finale was an extra episode titled “Mental Health and Youth from the Periphery: Psychosocial Distress and Care Production in the Pandemic Context,” resulting from a podcast episode submitted to the XI International Symposium on Brazilian Youth (JUBRA) held in December 2020.\nThe second season of the Presentemente podcast is still in progress. Four episodes have been released, from July to September 2021, on the themes of “Arts and Peripheries on the Agenda” and “Cultural Appropriation and Colonialities,” with the third and fourth episodes being two parts of the same conversation titled “Indigenous Peoples in Brazil.”",

    "text": "#TraçandoVáriosPlanos Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe #TraçandoVáriosPlanos podcast, which dialogues with the song “Sulamericano” by the Bahian musical group BaianaSystem, focuses on Social Psychology and Political Psychology readings on contemporary socio-psychological themes and processes. More than 14 episodes were released between 2020 and 2021, across the first two seasons. The production of #TraçandoVáriosPlanos always involves the participation of the advising professor or teaching internship students in the presentation, as well as guests from the academic context. All episodes, averaging 40 minutes, are available for free on YouTube on the Pós-PsicologiaS UFC channel and also on Spotify.\nThe released episodes covered themes such as: “Psychosocial Aspects of Violence and Social Psychology”; “Neoliberalism and the Necroeconomy of Punishment: Racism, Mass Incarceration, and Pandemic Impacts”; “Social Psychology and Hate Speech Today”; “Critical Criminology, Feminist Criminology, and the Problem of Punitive Penal Selectivity”; “Neoliberal Subjectivation and Social Psychology”; “Social Transformations of Violence and Prison Dynamics: The Case of Ceará”; “Beyond Prison: Alternative Penal Policy or Alternative to Penal Policy?”; “Intersectionality, Production of Subjectivities, and Social Psychology”; “Gender and Subjectivity from Feminist Studies”; and “Can the White Listen? – Reflections on Whiteness”; “Social Psychology and Inequalities in the COVID-19 Pandemic”; “Psychology and Extremisms Today”; “Psychosocial Aspects of Racism and Anti-Racist Psychology”; and “Denialism and the Public Dimension of Mourning in the Pandemic: Connections Between Subjectivity and Politics.”\nIn 2022, a special season on Psychology and Human Rights was produced. Its 12 episodes came from panels held during an extension course on this theme promoted by VIESES in 2021.\n#TraçandoVáriosPlanos has proven to be an important strategy for maintaining and enhancing the connection of students with the Psychology course at UFC by offering learning and reflection alternatives in the face of reality and challenges posed by social distancing, being fundamental to expanding the reach of themes debated by VIESES far beyond its student body through new communication and information tools.",

Aimed at encouraging insurgent practices and strengthening the cultural memory of urban peripheries by enhancing the artistic-cultural expressions of youth collectives from the neighborhoods of Grande Bom Jardim (GBJ), in Fortaleza-CE2, the project has shown a significant social role in peripheral territories, especially with students from public schools and members of youth collectives from GBJ. Since the first semester of 2021, one of the project’s action fronts has been producing a podcast to disseminate and dialogue with members of actions, activities, and projects within youth collectives that fight for rights in GBJ and use art as a tool of struggle, from various artistic language expressions, such as visual arts, literature, music, dance, and theater.\nSo far, the podcast, titled “Artes Insurgentes: Collectivizing Resistances,” has three episodes ranging from 20 to 50 minutes, available on Spotify. The first episode consists of a presentation of the project and its proposals; the second episode addresses issues related to the 2021 Youth Festival and its repercussions for the local scene; and the third episode, the most recent, discusses actions taken by the Specialized Technical Articulation Nucleus (Narte) of the Bom Jardim Cultural Center and its resonances in the GBJ community.\nIn 2022, the first episode of the Artes Insurgentes podcast, titled “Resistances and Alliances in the Breaks,” was released, addressing how residents of the Grande Bom Jardim region participated in political and social movements related to combating violence and fighting for human rights in their territories in the city.",

Aiming to promote welcoming actions at the university in times of weakened ties and attacks on public education, the Café da Tarde podcast sought to constitute, in the virtual environment, exchanges where everyday affections, student experiences, affective places, and processes of invention and sharing were invoked as forms of alliance and resistance to discouragement, understood as the political sentiment of our time.\nThe conversations included the following triggering themes: the university in times of remote learning, inventive ways of doing extension when it is not possible to be “in the field”; the implications and challenges of conducting research during the current health crisis; and the creative process of the podcast as a UFC project. The 12 guests were undergraduate and graduate students from the UFC Psychology course. The podcast was carried out by undergraduate students and the advising professor from VIESES. We highlight that the search for a sound and visual aesthetic (posts to promote the podcast) that allowed for erasures, intervals, silences, and interruptions was an ethical-aesthetic-political bet against neoliberal and productivity-driven models in Brazilian higher education. Not only that, it was a way to inhabit the virtual territory in the face of the imminent massification of distance education strategies within the university as a horizon of control over teaching-learning processes.",

    "section": "Final Considerations",
    "text": "Final Considerations\nThe above-listed communication products are contemporary productions that effectively address Psychology through collective and engaged technical production with social movements, productions that resonate their practices and impact the practice of Psychology, expanding content, debate, and involving communities, faculty, and students. Thus, modes of knowledge production are reinvented, encouraging and valuing practices that highlight challenges and impasses in the decolonization of Psychology (Miranda & Félix-Silva, 2022).\nThe creation of these technical productions, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of neo-fascist values and practices, started from the premise that addressing the multifaceted field of Human Rights through innovative strategies that broaden the reach and resonance of technical productions in Psychology is fundamental for promoting critical training in this area, linking undergraduate and graduate studies, ethically committed to transforming unequal realities in the Brazilian context, which still coexists with strong marks and practices of coloniality (Ballestrin, 2013; Lugones, 2014). To move against uncritical and reductionist approaches on the subject, the communication products could address realities and theoretical references of thinkers in Psychology and related fields that problematize cis-hetero-patriarchal-colonial-capitalist patterns (Silva et al., 2023).\nWe believe that these technical productions linked to VIESES are relevant for enhancing, strengthening, and stimulating reflections and experience reports on tackling inequalities, violence, and oppression in Brazil (Benicio et al., 2018). Furthermore, they have sought to contribute, within the scope of emergency remote teaching, to meeting society’s demands for elucidating sociopsychological aspects of violence and sharing successful experiences in defending human rights. These products have innovation potential, as they sought to create more interactive channels for discussion, re-elaboration, and dissemination of knowledge produced by VIESES-UFC research. The number of editions also shows the potential for replicating actions. The fact that the podcasts have been accessed by people in various countries shows their international reach. The articulations between undergraduate, graduate students, faculty, professionals, and members of social movements, as well as the need for the team to appropriate methods and techniques of curation, scripting, editing, and dissemination, demonstrate the high complexity of such technical productions.\nTherefore, it is believed that these communication products contribute to expanding the impact of the Graduate Program in Psychology at UFC on society by enhancing the resonances of discussions that have been dear to VIESES since its creation. This is because, with the podcasts, these problematizations could reach from undergraduate and graduate students to professionals, whether in Psychology or related fields, to public policy managers and members of collectives, social movements, and civil society organizations from different regions of Brazil and even beyond the national territory.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMuch has been discussed about the apparent gap between scientific knowledge and society. During the pandemic1, and even before it, we observed a resurgence of anti-scientific manifestations such as anti-vaccine movements, the return of flat earth beliefs, and the use of unproven medications for disease treatment. Similarly, institutions producing academic knowledge, such as schools, universities, and scientific communicators, have not succeeded in maintaining a dialogue with society. Often, the language used does not facilitate communication, and the use of jargon incomprehensible to the majority of the “lay” population creates an insurmountable barrier for those outside the academic sphere. While technical teaching still prevails in the academic environment, transdisciplinarity and dialogue emerge as a way to bridge academic-scientific knowledge with reality, cultural experiences, and individuals’ knowledge, allowing for enrichment and learning fundamental for the improvement of both dimensions without denying their specificities.\nThis chapter aims to present aspects that traverse and compose the Polyphonies extension project, highlighting both its practices, which generally characterize as a technical production of the “Event Organization” type, and the main theoretical guidelines that underpin them. To this end, the chapter is subdivided into 2 sections, respectively:\nAt the end, besides concisely revisiting the discussed points, some challenges for improving Polyphonies activities are listed.",

    "section": "Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project",
    "text": "Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project\nPolyphonies is an extension project of the Federal University of Ceará – Sobral Campus, which is based on the importance of transversal, transdisciplinary, decolonized, and transformative teaching that transcends the university’s barriers. Only through the democratization of knowledge is it possible to contribute to mitigating vulnerabilities, training more ethical professionals aware of their responsibility to the general community, and ensuring that different social actors actively participate in knowledge production. Thus, Polyphonies’ main objective is to disseminate scientific and philosophical knowledge using simple and accessible language that facilitates the approach and dialogue between academic and non-academic audiences.\nAlthough it was registered with the Extension Pro-Rectory only in January 2020, the project originated from a meeting held on October 31, 2019, in the Mucambinho auditorium (UFC/Sobral). The event featured the participation of four PhD professors affiliated with UFC/Sobral to discuss the topic of “Time” from the perspectives of Music, with Dr. Adeline Stervinou; Physics, with Dr. João Guilherme Matias Nogueira; Engineering, with Dr. José Cláudio do Nascimento; and Anthropology, with Dr. Denise Silva. Despite the high level of the guests, they were asked to address the topic in a comprehensible and engaging way for an audience that included students and professors from various undergraduate and graduate courses. Each guest had between 10 and 15 minutes to speak, followed by an open session for audience comments and questions.\nThe event was very successful, with an estimated participation of 80 to 90 people, and it was evident that everyone (guests and audience) was interested in exchanging ideas and making transdisciplinary connections in a setting where informality and scientific rigor were perfectly balanced. Professors and students from seemingly different courses such as Music, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Psychology engaged in deep and productive dialogues, momentarily forgetting their supposed disciplinary separation. The event’s receptiveness was so strong that students, guests, and professors approached the organizers afterward to suggest other dialogue topics, demonstrating their desire for the activity’s continuity. Consequently, plans began to take shape to ensure the event’s regular occurrence and expand its reach beyond the university’s walls.\nOnce registered with the proper authorities, the project’s coordinators sought, in early March 2020, to establish a partnership with the Sobral Municipal Education Secretariat (SEDUC). The search for SEDUC was not random but reflected Polyphonies’ commitment to extending beyond the university audience, provoking debates where multiple perspectives on a topic could flow. According to the plan, guests and school communities in basic education would have the chance to jointly create an environment for exchanges where the rigid marking of power and knowledge places would be continuously challenged.\nSEDUC embraced the partnership proposal, understanding that it would bring to the municipality a relevant experience of transdisciplinary and dialogical practices in the regular school environment; a stimulus for studying subjects and curriculum content and academic reading through transdisciplinary topics that provoke logical and complex reasoning in an accessible manner, among other benefits. In return, the secretariat would assist in promoting the events within the school community, providing physical space and/or transportation to the event location, and financial support for publications derived from each meeting. However, on March 16, 2020, Sobral declared its first period of social isolation due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic, postponing the developing plans with SEDUC until the health situation returned to normal.\nIt was then up to the newly formed Polyphonies team – 2 coordinating professors and 6 undergraduate students – like many other activities in various sectors, to reinvent planned actions for in-person delivery while maintaining the project’s central aspects and ensuring everyone’s health and safety. Considering the available possibilities and existing examples, the group opted to hold meetings online. Social networks and their popularity among different audiences emerged as a potentially interesting tool for achieving the project’s goals under the imposed health scenario. The apparent simplicity of social networks, their reach, and the speed of content dissemination made them the primary source for promoting the 7 events that subsequently took place. Instagram, initially a photo-sharing social network, became for many a professional dissemination tool, for quick tutorials, and news. Thus, it was a virtual space suitable for the mobilizations and contacts desired by the project.\nThe Polyphonies project account on Instagram was created on May 30, 2020, as a place that gathered information about the project and its activities, also serving as a virtual interaction space with interested audiences, currently having 287 followers. Over time and with the team’s maturation, the page also became a receptacle for posts with suggestions for artistic productions (series, books, films, and music) related to the theme of the most recent event. The choice of art was justified as an effective, democratic, and inviting dissemination form for the general public, mainly because its language is open to diverse views and subjectivity (Gomes, 2020). Additionally, introducing art in dialogical mediation with the project’s audience generated an initially unexpected product: Clubefonias, an action that gathers people of different age groups and realities via WhatsApp to discuss a work chosen by the members in biweekly meetings.\nBesides the Instagram page and the Clubefonias WhatsApp group, the project created a YouTube channel in August 2020 that hosts the recorded events. On this widely accessible social network, 3 of the 7 organized meetings are available.\nOn June 16, 2020, the first virtual event took place via Google Meet, bringing together university professors with experience in Art, Philosophy, and Psychology and a representative of an African-based religion to discuss the theme “All Roads Lead to Knowledge.” The theme was chosen by the Polyphonies team to introduce the project’s proposal to the general public without appearing as a lecture and without imposing a limited way of thinking about knowledge. The idea was to indicate openness to dialogue and the project’s transdisciplinary nature through the event title. During registration for the “live,” participants were invited to suggest topics for future discussions, thus seeking to access their interests and realities. The event had 86 registrants, lasted 2 hours, and certificates were issued for guests and participants.\nA few days after the inaugural event, the project team met to collectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses to be improved in future actions. This moment proved essential and has since been incorporated into the extension group’s meeting schedule. As a result of these event analyses, some modifications or action guidelines were implemented: ensuring space for audience questions/comments within the event time; reducing the meeting duration from 2 hours to 1 hour, considering the excess of virtual activities since the pandemic; decreasing the number of guests to 2 per session; creating 3 guiding questions distributed to the guests upon invitation, facilitating communication between different perspectives and their connection to everyday concerns; rotating the student team members as event moderators, as this contributes to their professional development; intensifying event promotion via WhatsApp and other means to reach more people outside the university; changing the event’s name from “Round Table Discussion” to “Bar Talk.”\nThe choice of the name “Bar Talk” deserves special attention, as it is linked to understanding that the “role of scientific dissemination has evolved over time, following the development of science and technology” (Albagli, 1996). In times of fast communication and social networks, it was considered important to adapt the name to the type of event held by Polyphonies. While “Round Table Discussion” conveys a dialogical and informal disposition, it also carries the image of an academic action common within school and university walls. However, “Bar Talk” evokes a space not associated with the scientific universe, and thus, it not only highlights the informality of the conversation and dialogue but also suggests active participation where discussions are accessible and stimulating. By distancing the events from a scientific dissemination praxis characterized by the difficulties of transmitting knowledge that academic and scientific circles display, the project reinforces openness to dialogue with other types of audiences and the opportunity to engage with various topics. Thus, scientific dissemination assumes essential roles in democratizing scientific knowledge and, consequently, opens doors to scientific literacy, contributing to including citizens in specialized topic debates that, even without many knowing, are intrinsically linked to and influence their lives (Bueno, 2010), as well as adding to the education of so-called ‘intellectuals’ by giving them the chance to expand/exercise new languages and articulations from their expertise.\nIt is worth noting that the internal meetings of the Polyphonies team, held biweekly on Fridays, are important not only due to the “technical” decisions that arise from them. In fact, the group’s meetings have served as a way to foster light and creative connections among participants, as most members did not have the chance to strengthen bonds in person, given that the pandemic began shortly after they joined the team. Approaching people virtually was the main challenge faced by the project, but the group’s internal experience has been a successful example of how dialogical thinking and practice combined with transdisciplinarity are potent for building humanized and enriching social bonds.\nBetween March 16, 2020, and August 2021, when this chapter was written, Polyphonies conducted 7 events, bringing together 298 participants, including 16 guests (11 from academic backgrounds and 5 from non-academic backgrounds). In addition to the topic of the first meeting, already described, the subjects addressed were: Pandemic and family relationships; Contemporary work relationships; Art and social transformation; Fake news and its impacts on society; Social movements; Language – Norms, power, and social transformations. These themes, whenever possible, took into account the suggestions presented by the audience during event registration. To date, the project has recorded 17 topics brought by participants.\nDespite this predominantly informative and practical description of the Polyphonies project, it is only possible to truly understand it by illuminating, albeit briefly, the theoretical and ethical pillars underlying its actions. This is the purpose of the next section.",

    "text": "Theoretical and Ethical Pillars of Polyphonies\n\nTransdisciplinarity\nTransdisciplinarity is understood as what is, at the same time, between, through, and beyond any discipline. The term, according to Guedes (2010), was first used by Piaget in 1970 but was only formalized in 1994 with the document “Charter of Transdisciplinarity” at the First World Congress in Portugal. Transdisciplinarity seeks to “transgress the logic of non-contradiction, articulating opposites: subject and object, subjectivity and objectivity, matter and consciousness, simplicity and complexity, unity and diversity” (Nicolescu, 1999; Santos, 2008). In other words, transdisciplinarity understands that reality can be viewed integratively, blurring the boundaries between forms of knowledge and asserting that the whole – reality – is highly complex and integrated, and the parts – sciences, for instance – actively communicate and sustain each other. This approach breaks with the fixed and timeless idea of dichotomies, understanding them as interactive agents that must be considered from the relationships they establish among themselves. Thus, Santos (2008) states that “the understanding of reality ascends to another level, taking on a broader meaning and always open to new processes” (p. 5).\nA serious analysis of the history of science reveals the transdisciplinary dimension of science, as scientific knowledge and society are intimately intertwined. The formation and consolidation of science point to a specific way of responding to society’s questions and needs (Videira, 2004).\nBeyond this social rootedness, which shows that science is not external to the world, it is important to apply the transdisciplinary perspective to the very structure of science. While the departmentalization of science allows for undeniable advances through highly specialized studies, discoveries in each field and subfield of knowledge need to be repositioned within the complex web of reality that is not abstractly fragmented into study fields. In this sense, it is fundamental to recognize scientific knowledge as constituted by diverse professionals with diverse knowledges that relate and intersect. Thus, transdisciplinarity, by not disregarding the complex aspects of reality and valuing its multiplicity, enhances dialogue between science and society and between different spheres of scientific knowledge.\nFrom this perspective, Martinazzo (2020) suggests that transdisciplinarity is a better path to understanding a complex and multidimensional reality, as it uses mechanisms that enable adaptation to this multiplicity. Transdisciplinarity, by considering both the complex and the simple to comprehend reality, allows various fields to be contemplated in knowledge as they articulate in the world, making room for opposing ideas to be considered and for all fields of knowledge to exercise their importance.\nTransdisciplinarity aims to overcome the closed universe produced by science by bringing forth the multiplicity of knowledge production modes and recognizing the importance of reintegrating the subject into the scientific observation process, given the strong interdependence between the observer, the observation process, and the observed object (Martinazzo, 2020, p. 7).\nThus, transdisciplinarity, in its pursuit of knowledge reintegration and the subject’s participation in scientific production, also facilitates the broader dissemination of knowledge, especially in societies where knowledge diffusion is often hindered by social inequalities, highlighting the elitist nature of knowledge access in these cultures. Indeed, this rapprochement is built because transdisciplinary practice strengthens the democratization of scientific knowledge by considering that this knowledge is produced for society and recognizing that non-scientific knowledge is relevant for understanding the world. Additionally, transdisciplinarity is linked to scientific dissemination, as it adapts to the complex and multidimensional reality, values contextualization, and creates an environment where divergent ideas and practices have the opportunity to be confronted respectfully and rigorously. Thus, transdisciplinarity fosters the dialogue essential for democratizing knowledge and genuinely democratic and free societies.\nHaving outlined the qualities and potentials of transdisciplinarity, the question remains: how can we promote transdisciplinary practices from the Brazilian university setting?\nClues to answering this question lie in the previously mentioned definition of transdisciplinarity, indicating the need to flexibilize knowledge boundaries through an integrated understanding of reality. Based on this, for scientific knowledge dissemination to occur, it is essential to devise strategies that ensure the traversal of physical and social barriers to knowledge access without neglecting the inherent possibilities of contemporary technologies. This is the arena where the Polyphonies Project operates with its events and actions.\nThe project’s actions aim to address various contemporary issues from a contextualized and multifaceted perspective, understanding that even the simplest topic carries a multiplicity of information studied from plural theoretical and practical perspectives. Because they are plural, they can be approached from different references, giving the topic a transdisciplinary character. Let’s take the first event, “All Roads Lead to Knowledge,” as an example. As mentioned earlier, the meeting featured 4 guests, including 3 university professors (linked to Art, Psychology, and/or Philosophy) and a religious representative. On this occasion, each guest spoke about a type of knowledge related to their field (Art, Philosophy, Science, and Religion), highlighting not only their specificities but also their relationships with the other represented spheres. The event’s transdisciplinary goal was successful, as the intertwined speeches of the guests effectively broke the traditional barriers between those knowledge fields, and the audience’s participation through comments and questions gave/amplified the meaning of what was discussed while simultaneously glimpsing interaction points in the diverse speakers’ discourses. In this first activity, the strength and, consequently, the need for transdisciplinary practices in scientific and non-scientific fields became evident as tools for enhancing the dissemination of knowledge integrated with society.\n\n\nScientific Dissemination\nDiscussing scientific dissemination requires revisiting a few centuries to consider the very act of doing science. As highlighted by Moreira (2002, Novembro 14-15), the known scientific revolution occurred in the mid-17th century, influenced by various sociodemographic factors, bringing to the forefront many thinkers who are now scientific references, such as Kepler and Galileo. However, despite the growing recognition of scientific relevance and the development of technologies that expanded access to intellectual products, science remains in the hands of specific and small groups – albeit significantly larger and more diverse than in previous centuries – while most of the population remains ignorant of the scientific and technological knowledge production processes underlying the presented ways of life.\nAs previously mentioned, despite the many knowledge produced within research centers and university academies, their connection with the external public leaves much to be desired. The dissemination of what is produced usually does not reach those outside the scientific sphere, even though this seems to occur unintentionally, as nothing indicates that researchers are interested in this segregation. The problem of poor knowledge distribution has already concerned Lima Vaz (2000), who emphasized:\n\nThe great scientific revolutions of our century, while propelling technical progress, make the understanding of deep theoretical connections between scientific thought and technical practice more enigmatic to the common man, user of the objects that technology offers for his consumption and satisfaction. (p. 278).\n\nOne consequence of this poor knowledge distribution can be seen in today’s anti-scientific movements, which, using resources that only exist due to the development of science and technology, propagate distorted and false information that fuels unfounded conspiracy theories with potentially devastating effects in politics, health, economy, environment, etc.\nThis reveals the urgency of rethinking the ways in which scientific knowledge dissemination has occurred – or failed to occur. More than ever, creating spaces where science and society can interact fluidly is essential. A fluid interaction capable of effectively disseminating academic knowledge requires always remembering that the audience addressed by the knowledge will consist of “lay” people. This implies considering not only the dissemination medium but also the language used.\nTraditionally, sciences adopt a discourse type aimed at knowledge diffusion to a restricted audience. Thus, scientific communication among peers does not usually need to make concessions in its specialized discourse, as despite using restricted language, it finds its primary interlocutor in a very specific audience familiar with that vocabulary and data presentation form. However, when aiming to expand beyond those groups versed in academic jargon, scientists and intellectuals usually act believing, as Bueno (2010) points out, “that their audience shares the same concepts and that technical jargon constitutes common heritage” (p. 3). However, presuming that the chosen words for the discourse already carry specific meanings and functions cannot be dissociated from the notion that these meanings and functions take shape through contact with the listener. Therefore, in contact with individuals outside the scientific environment, words requiring a conception restricted to researchers’ circles do not convey meanings (Authier-Revuz, 2015) and undermine the dissemination effort.\nIn this context, Polyphonies aims to practice scientific dissemination, understanding it as a process of recoding specialized discourse to make content accessible to a broad audience (Bueno, 2010), an effort to translate and decode information shaped in academic-scientific codes and jargon into more familiar language understandable by the scientifically uneducated public (Bueno, 2010). The project assumes that knowledge dissemination is appropriate in “any activity of explaining and spreading knowledge, culture, and scientific and technical thought, under two conditions: outside official or equivalent education and without the aim of training specialists” (Marandino et al., 2003, p. 5), and, based on this, proposes a colloquial conversation among different actors related to the selected event theme. In this interaction, driven by questions previously sent to the guests, researchers, practitioners (professionals, social movement participants, etc.), and the public have the chance to adjust and expand their different vocabularies, collectively weaving a glossary that harmonizes theories, practices, and experiences. Thus, the commitment to scientific dissemination results in a commitment to dialogue as a core pillar of Polyphonies.\n\n\nDialogue\nWith the idea of dialogism, Mikhail Bakhtin shed light on the dialogical interactions that constitute and are woven between discourses, asserting that the dialogical relationship is constitutive of language (Marcuzzo, 2008; Rechdan, 2003). According to him, humans must always be seen in their relationship with others, as “it is impossible to think of a person outside the relationships that bind them to others” (Faraco, 1996, as cited in Marcuzzo, 2008, p. 4). Thus, the dialogical dimension is not only present in language and discourses but continuously traverses our identity. Despite this foundational intertwining that links self and other, establishing dialogical relationships where one voice does not submit to others is not guaranteed a priori. Here, the notion of polyphony comes into play, pointing to a dialogical movement where “different social voices … confront each other, clash, manifesting different social viewpoints on a given object …” (Rechdan, 2003, p. 46). This concept aptly names the project: Polyphonies activities mobilize diverse social voices, creating an environment where distinct discourses have the opportunity to cross and consciously redraw themselves, recognizing their identities are not static or independent of their connection to the other.\nAs seen in the transdisciplinarity section, the project embraces the notion that knowledge construction operates multiply and constantly, encompassing different aspects that are shaped, transformed, or cease to be validated as they relate. This aligns with the idea that reality is complex, i.e., it does not have only one level, one side, one knowledge, all comprehensible definitively. From this angle, the hierarchicalization of knowledge or certain areas as less or more important loses a priori significance, as the engine and validation of knowledge are understood as inseparable from the flow of knowledge, experiences, and consequences at play.\nPolyphonies’ journey seeks to keep in mind that not only reality but also the individuals inhabiting and composing it are complex. Thus, in pursuing its commitment to having a transformative effect on the world, the project considers individuals as bearers of histories, experiences, and worldviews (Lucena et al., 2016). Accordingly, Paulo Freire (2008) is an indispensable reference, understanding that “dialogue is, in itself, creative and re-creative” [and that] “dialogue seals the act of learning, which is never individual, although it has an individual dimension” (pp. 13-14). Adopting Freire’s view, Polyphonies strives to convene, through dialogue, individuals as creative subjects endowed with unique riches, whose action/inaction impacts reality. By embedding dialogue as a core part of its activities, the project reinforces the idea that knowledge is a product of the collective of subjects who, consciously or not, invent and reinvent the world.\nTherefore, considering scientific dissemination through dialogical lenses reaffirms the previously discussed need to subvert conventional relationships with language to create diverse spaces where words make sense for everyone. This task is especially challenging in a country with high social inequality and income concentration, requiring serious consideration that in formal lectures, congresses, or even classrooms, the language used can include or exclude subjects who have historically had their knowledge denied and erased by the imposition of a hegemonic culture, including scientific theories and institutions.\nChauí (2002) invites us to take the next step, recalling that “democracy brings to the fore the problem of violence, that is, the reduction of the subject to the condition of a thing” (p. 68). In other words, by adopting dialogue as a form of scientific dissemination, Polyphonies is not simply concerned with the cosmetic dimension of language, making it palatable and accessible to those outside the academic milieu. More than that, the project’s events aim to value the myriad ways individuals produce, signify, and narrate cultures and knowledge.\nThus, Polyphonies’ actions counter a ‘colonizing mission,’ whose project was to homogenize the world, obliterating cultural differences. Through deeply anti-democratic and anti-dialogical colonization, much social experience was wasted, and the world’s epistemological, cultural, and political diversity was reduced. Those who managed to survive colonizing advances were subjected to the dominant epistemological norm (Santos, 2008).\nBy establishing dialogue as an inescapable guideline for its activities, Polyphonies acknowledges the existence of a coloniality of knowledge and positions itself against it. Admitting that speech implies power relations means not shying away from repeatedly asking: Who speaks? To whom does one speak? About what does one speak? How does one speak? Which discursive practices are being denied, and which are being legitimized? Whom does this discourse serve?\nAsking these questions and being committed to revisiting them regularly outlines the project’s ethical horizon, prompting its members to continually think of ways to create spaces where knowledge can circulate dialogically, where all voices matter, and where scientific dissemination is effective precisely because the walls separating scientific knowledge from popular knowledge can be collectively redrawn.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What Moves Thought to Think\nThe work we present here originates from our commitment to building a society without asylums. From a Deleuzian perspective that “more important than thought is what ‘gives one to think’…” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 89), we were driven by this struggle to create devices that articulated what was experienced in contact with our field of intervention, namely a Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS), and the production and dissemination of knowledge, in an attempt to invent spaces, beyond academic activity, that enable the deconstruction of the stigma of madness.\nThe production of knowledge constructed in/through immersion in the field relies on the perspective of the tension that the insertion of bodies in a given territory exerts, as it drives the construction of new knowledge, practices, and experiments. Referencing cartography as a research method and access to reality, according to Barros and Kastrup (2009), the cartographer opens up to the movement of a territory and unravels variables of a production process in this contact.\nIn this sense, the experience of organizing an event in honor of the National Day of the Anti-Asylum Struggle emerges as a significant technical production, enabling reflection on constructing engaged and embodied knowledge that extends beyond classrooms and academic walls. Organized by the PASÁRGADA group: Promotion of Art, Health, and Guarantee of Rights, linked to the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), Fortaleza campus, in partnership with the substitute service, other groups, and social movements, the Anti-Asylum Week, held in 2022, constituted an event aiming to engage the community in defending care in freedom, based on the need to irradiate a new social vision affirming madness in the sphere of coexistence, with free circulation in the city’s fabric.\nIn this venture, we started with a perspective that conceives defending the rights of people in psychological distress as a social transformation project that goes beyond the physical extinction of asylums and all societal mechanisms of exclusion and silencing of madness, understanding that “the asylum issue echoes far beyond the psychiatric hospital walls or the strict domain of asylum practices, extending throughout the social fabric” (Prado Filho & Lemos, 2020, p. 55). In other words, the production of this event stems from the idea that resisting the asylum system requires contaminating the streets, challenging the thoughts of those entrenched in oppressive and exclusionary perspectives on madness and difference.\nWith Deleuze (2003), we learned that “without something that forces one to think, without something that violates thought, it means nothing” (p. 89). Thus, to provoke thought beyond what is prescribed by common sense, it is necessary to create a state of strangeness, always involuntary, that breaks the mere recognition of the external world, which is provoked by signs: “what forces us to think is the sign. The sign is the object of an encounter; but it is precisely the contingency of the encounter that guarantees the necessity of what it makes us think” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 91).\nThinking is, therefore, an activity triggered involuntarily under the violence of encountering signs, which should not be confused with signifiers, as signs have no pre-given meaning to be recognized. Instead, “the sign implies in itself heterogeneity as a relation” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 21), so every sign implies an opening of worlds that affects us in such a way as to push our faculties beyond their usual limits. Thus, the sign is directly affective, and thinking originates from affection. This is particularly important to us as it provides the necessary openness to conceive the production of knowledge as an intensive and bodily experience, far from a recognitive attitude.\nWhat we advocate here is that thinking does not start from something pre-established but from production through sensitivities. Our challenge, therefore, was to enable intensive encounters through signs that affirmed the production and propagation of knowledge as a sensitive and engaged experience. More than that, we know that the sign, as an affect, is effective in constructing other worlds incompatible with the established (Nascimento, 2012), so the centrality of our initiative was linked to creating disturbance spaces that, by force of the encounter, tensioned the place of madness in the social body and infected others with the idea of care in freedom.\nThus, we proposed an event that constitutes a technical production aimed at constructing an anti-asylum psychology. This initiative is especially necessary during setbacks in Brazil’s national mental health policy, resulting from the approval of a series of political projects contrary to the ideals of a society free from asylums, whether mental or structural. Given this scenario, we argue that it is more necessary than ever to provoke thought about madness and mental health care, preparing the ground for creating other ways of relating to difference.\nWe also remember that the persistence of an asylum logic within the substitute services is one of the major challenges faced by the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS), often originating in the formative processes of health professionals who fail to deconstruct the relations of domination and chronification of users typical of asylum models. To resist this, we created an innovative product, resulting from our interventions and studies on mental health care, which places the affection and contagion of reality as premises for producing and disseminating knowledge in times of tension and dispute in this field. Below, we will share some of the construction of this event, which was, above all, an experiment in knowledge produced with the other.",

    "text": "Affecting and Moving: Inventing the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Week”\nThe Anti-Asylum Struggle Week initiative results from studies on mental health care and the continued insertion that the PASÁRGADA program has had in this field since 2019. Through university extension, the group has developed activities in two Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS) - Type II in Fortaleza-CE. These actions include therapeutic group follow-ups, activities in the services’ waiting rooms, and actions beyond these facilities’ walls.\nSuch interventions rely on art as a device that enables fluidity of expression in its various forms and expands communicative notions by transcending language through senses that pulse beyond speech. Deleuze and Guattari (2010) affirm that “art wants to create a finite that restores the infinite: it traces a composition plan that carries, in turn, monuments or composed sensations, under the action of aesthetic figures” (p. 253). In this sense, the inventiveness characteristic of this device allows access to a given content that transcends the artist, the work, and the subject who visualizes it, dimensioning a vibrant reality proposing new ways of accessing life aesthetically and sensitively.\nWith this perspective, we understand that art is not limited to a humanizing tool for care, as it is also a resource that offers, through experimentation, new subjective anchors for people in psychological distress, giving them the possibility to reinvent themselves and the world. As Costa, Zanella, and Fonseca (2016) point out, art influences the composition of overflows of the established limits imposed on research, intervention, and existence. Thus, it arises for us as a form of resistance to the hegemonic ways of living imposed on madness, affirming a process of expanding the fields it can inhabit, whether concrete – in this case, social – or subjective. Therefore, our alliance with art is also made from an ethical and political struggle perspective, linked to overcoming psychiatric and asylum institutions, which have gained strength in recent years.\nDue to the social isolation situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, care provided in CAPS was mainly limited to psychiatric and psychological care and medication distribution, given the impossibility of conducting collective activities such as therapeutic and operative groups in person. Consequently, a scenario favorable to advancing outpatient and medicalizing care logic was cultivated in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network before the pandemic crisis (Guimarães & Sampaio, 2016), but which severely worsened during this context, implying a significant setback for psychiatric reform and the anti-asylum project, already greatly weakened by the advance of neoliberalism and conservatism in the country.\nThe vision of constructing the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event arose from the loosening of sanitary measures and the return of in-person activities in early 2022. It also emerges from the memory that constitutes PASÁRGADA, which, in its years of existence, has conducted various actions stitching together health services, universities, social movements, and society. Crossed by what Deleuze (1992) asserts when he says “a little bit of possible, otherwise I suffocate…” (p. 131), we are called to re-enchant May 18 in a context of psychological, social, and political fragility, as well as setbacks in psychiatric reform and uncertainty regarding the reality we once knew and are called to inhabit again after the COVID-19 calamity.\nIt is worth noting that the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day reflects a series of disputes and the active participation of the community, workers, families, and people in psychological distress. Espírito Santo, Araújo, and Amarante (2016) state that, from the emergence of the Mental Health Workers Movement (MTSM) in the 1970s, denunciations against the treatment model then used as a reference in the mental health field reverberated. The strictly biomedical perspective, along with reports of violence against the bodies inhabiting so-called care spaces, described an unsustainable situation, resulting in the 8th National Health Conference and, a year later, the First National Mental Health Conference. The emergency and change scenario produced during the second MTSM congress in 1987 established May 18 as a symbolic date for maintaining and engaging in a rights struggle, care in freedom, and de-asyluming life.\nAmarante and Nunes (2018) highlight that during the occasion, the slogan “For a society without asylums” was created, and the social movement became more complex, gaining participation from new social actors (users, families, and other human rights activists). Additionally, a new horizon of demand was built, focused on deconstructing the asylum logic and its institutional apparatus, thus constituting itself as the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Movement (MLA).” According to the authors:\n\nA decisive element for this expansion [of the MLA] was the creation of the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day in Bauru. May 18 would serve to awaken critical thinking in society about the institutional violence of psychiatry and the exclusion of people in psychological distress. It can be considered that the objective was successful to the extent that, since then, political, scientific, cultural, and social activities have been carried out not only on the day in question but throughout the month of May, which came to be considered the Anti-Asylum Struggle Month. Given the significant repercussion of the events organized by the MLA and their substantial participation in broader health issues, the term “mentalistas” (in reference to heavy metal) became widely used to characterize the “noise” caused by this social actor (Amarante & Nunes, 2018, p. 2070).\n\nThus, given the importance of this date, guided by the construction of comprehensive care, in freedom and integration (in the network), we questioned how to create crossings that could disrupt what is rigid in psychosocial care and continue the proposal of care that transcends the service structure. The challenges arise from the intersection of a moment of collective mourning, physical reinsertion into previously uninhabited spaces, and significant sensitization regarding mental health and social ties. Therefore, we are called to challenge the established and bet on inventiveness and affection as mobilizing forces, creating the 2022 Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event.\nThis event featured diverse activities distributed over five days, namely:\n\nMonday: a procession through Benfica and a discussion circle at the university.\nTuesday: an action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV and a panel discussion at the university.\nWednesday: participation in the public act promoted by the Ceará Anti-Asylum Struggle Forum (FCLA) in the city center.\nThursday: organization of an exhibition; and\nFriday: in-person display of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” exhibition at São José Theater.\n\nThe construction and implementation of this venture were only possible thanks to the alliances built with partner institutions and professionals, users, social movements, university sectors, and a range of agencies that, according to Deleuze and Guattari (2003), “… extend or penetrate an unlimited field of immanence that melts segments, freeing desire from all its concretions and abstractions, or at least actively struggles against them to dissolve them” (p. 145). Thus, we sought to create crossings that brought movement to the crystallized practices in the mental health field.\nThe event began on May 16, Monday, with a procession through the streets of Benfica, a neighborhood with a high flow of people and the location of the UFC Psychology Department. The act was carried out alongside the carnival block “Doido é Tu!”. This moment aimed to compose a struggle that arises from alliances and through boundary transgression, proposing a contagion with the city, the university, art, and culture, weaving the struggle for ethical-political care. As Martins (2009) points out, “in anti-asylum practices, the city, madness, and art meet and together make an appeal for life. They demand less life to be lived and more pulsating life…” (p. 86).\nThe procession emitted notes that vibrated through the city, prompting passing cars to honk and pedestrians to shout with us, through a porosity that permeated boundaries. We took flight, sang, walked, danced, shouted, and landed. The act ended at the Moreira Campos Forest, located in the Center for Humanities I at UFC, where we gathered and settled for a discussion circle titled “Anti-Asylum Struggles: Still!”. This location was purposely chosen, as it has a high flow of people moving daily, potentially engaging with the proposed discussion.\nWe aimed to enter the university by shattering crystallizations regarding madness and seeking to broaden this debate not only within a course focused on mental health, such as Psychology, but for society as a whole. In agreement with the Basaglian perspective, we proposed to discuss the possibility of inventing new strategies for restructuring cultural organization regarding the presence of the subject in distress and the disturbance they determine, producing other modes of expressing this experience of suffering (Basaglia, 2010).\nSettling visibly to passersby, singing, dancing, dialoguing, and inquiring: can madness occupy the university? In this composition between passing flows, the large circle included users and service professionals, professors, and students from various university courses. It was realized through the collective space of sharing and discussing the history of the Anti-Asylum Struggle and Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, its processes and setbacks, and the need to maintain it today.\nAt this moment, the struggle was tensioned as pluralized, as it is also an anti-racist, anti-LGBTQUIAP+phobic, and anti-fascist struggle, configuring itself as a demand for care that promotes quality of life for the bodies occupying this space. Basaglia (1985), analyzing the condition of the institutionalized, places the subject in psychological distress as a subject without rights, subjected to institutional powers, socially excluded due to their social and economic condition rather than the illness itself. Stela do Patrocínio (2009), a Black poet interned for almost 30 years, tells us that “being interned is being imprisoned all day” (p. 47), thus the asylum being a strategy for controlling and imprisoning bodies, mainly Black and poor. Therefore, it is crucial to think of mental health care that is provided in freedom and intersectionalized, recognizing the identity markers placed in the field of subordination, producing illnesses and new forms of the asylum.\nOn the second day of the event, we organized a morning action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV. This activity is a standard practice of Pasárgada since its insertion in health facilities, during waiting times for appointments or medication, for example. We propose interactive activities, provocative installations, and interventions that move the bodies present, aiming to subvert the outpatient logic marking this waiting time. Furthermore, aligning with Deleuze’s (1999, 27 de junho) association between art and resistance, we aim to construct other possibilities for life production through the contact between the device and mental health.\nUnderstanding the possibility of constructing possible paths of life, other creations for existence, the activity had the key question “What do we do to be free?”, with pens, colored pencils, markers, glue, colorful glue, and images, as well as a poster on an easel for producing a collective work from this trigger. The objective was to think about what freedom meant to each person, what affected them in this sense, and how it could be understood expansively and collectively, understanding the processes of subjectivation and the ways existence weaves itself beyond the neoliberal and individualistic ideal. The action was planned as care involved in not individualizing users, proposing, instead, a process of constructing collective resistances against systematic oppressions that attempt to suffocate difference, through forming alliances as a possible bet in the care in freedom experimentation process.\nAdditionally, in the afternoon, a panel discussion was held at the Center for Humanities II at UFC, proposed by VIESES (Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation Group), in partnership with FCLA, with support from PASÁRGADA, titled “Mental Health Care in Ceará: Concerns and Propositions.” The panel discussion focused on the mental health of children and adolescents and their current challenges; necropolitics and its impacts on mental health; and political disputes surrounding care for alcohol and other drug users. We understood this space as an opportunity to provoke critical academic thought about the reality of mental health in Ceará today, articulating different social actors from various contexts.\nThe setbacks in mental health policies highlighted by Passarinho (2022) when discussing government funding of therapeutic communities and psychiatric hospitals in the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS) emerged in this moment through the voices of workers and users. Moreover, the poor management of worker care, alongside the scarcity of public contests in this field – strategies for strengthening the bond between professionals and users through the permanence in the service – was highlighted as a central tool for proposing ethical care.\nThe disregard for children and adolescents’ mental health due to lack of incentive and the policy of youth mortification marked by race, gender, and socioeconomic status was another emphasized topic. The logic of making live and letting die that promotes life only for bodies considered normal was evident at this moment through the reports brought by those involved in this network, corroborating Mbembe’s (2018) notion that, “in the economy of biopower, the function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and make possible the murderous functions of the State” (p. 18).\nFurthermore, it was stated that the lack of incentive for harm reduction policy in favor of prohibitionist logics perpetuating the dynamics in the field of assistance to alcohol and other drug users chronifies the problem and reproduces asylum and violence practices. Harm reduction promotes a joint construction for experiences with psychoactive substances involving participation in policy management in the field and the reduction or even cessation of drug use (E. H. Passos & Souza, 2011). The panel discussion discussing these three axes raised many concerns and brought propositions around what was discussed, aiming to take the highlighted points to conferences and forums, contributing to public policy planning.\nOn the third day of action promotion, May 18, 2022, we made an ethical-political commitment to be in the street, participating in the act organized and led by FCLA and mobilizing the academic community to join this activity. The concentration for the political demonstration for care in freedom took place at Praça do Ferreira, in the city center, to create new visibility zones for madness, as Silva (2006) points out, the place is historically marked by\n\n… significant social content, constituting itself, over the years, as an “icon” for Fortaleza. A traditional meeting and sociability place, it was an excellent leisure space, still today the square of greatest representation in the center. The great vitality that takes place there becomes noticeable through cultural events, social manifestations, and the persistence of some uses that have been resisting the transformations in that public space. (p. 106)\n\nAmarante (2007) states that there is a sociocultural dimension in the Brazilian psychiatric reform process that is strategic in attempting to provoke the social imaginary through questioning about madness, mental illness, and psychiatric hospitals, based on the cultural and artistic production of social actors composing this movement. In this sense, historically, as mentioned above, May 18 and the following days mark social, cultural, and political movements with the participation of users, professionals, and families to claim and guarantee rights, care policies, and occupy the city for the anti-asylum struggle.\nThus, being on the street, occupying the city with art, music, dance, and slogans, is necessary. Inhabiting this territory as a meeting point, with bodies denied access to public space, is a process of affirming difference. Being there, professionals, users, families, students, politicians, and militants, is a bet on destabilizing what is set in macro-politics and the asylum structure, announcing our presence as a demand for the right to the city. Additionally, persisting as a group gathering on this date, amid a challenging political scenario – especially concerning public health – constitutes a collective construction of care and an ethical-political commitment to the anti-asylum agenda that must be strengthened. We also emphasize that participating in this act highlights the perspective of knowledge not only produced within university walls theoretically but also constructed through experimentation with the social actors involved and their life contexts.\nAgain, the carnival block “Doido é tu!” was present, enhancing this moment with music and dances. We produced posters, raised flags, and walked together to the headquarters of the Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat, where a letter written by FCLA listing and demanding points for effective care in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network was delivered.\nOn May 19, we focused on organizing and assembling our final action for that Week, which was characterized by the in-person exhibition of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” project. Thus, on May 20, we had this exhibition in partnership with CAPS II - CORES IV in Fortaleza. The idea for this action emerged from the desire to echo this artistic presentation, which initially took place virtually, with production starting in 2021, when the idea was proposed to one of the art therapy groups to create and organize works for an exhibition, culminating in 2022. The objective was to think and create an exhibition together with the artist and the group users, constructing a collective exhibition from the activities proposed in the group, resulting in the arts, the theme of the exhibition, the website, and the curatorial process.\nDespite the difficulties of constructing a care process through hybrid contact amid a pandemic, the virtual exhibition opened on February 16, 2022, with the website’s launch alongside the artists in a discussion circle via Google Meet, and closed on March 16, 2022. Thus, primarily proposing a relationship transforming Western society’s relationship with madness (Amarante, 1994), we brought the exhibition to the in-person format at São José Theater in Fortaleza, concluding the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week.\nSão José Theater, the chosen exhibition site, was created in 1914 and is a historic facility in Fortaleza, located in the city center, representing a significant cultural hub. Recently renovated after years of closure, it now features an important cultural program for the city. Thus, the choice of the theater stemmed from our previously stated desire to occupy the urban space in highly trafficked locations.\nThe works composing the in-person exhibition were the same as those in the virtual exhibition but with a different configuration, featuring interactive frames made by the artist-users with materials like bottle caps, sequins, threads, glitter, and even seeds. Additionally, all works were suspended with colorful strings, proposing movement with bodies beyond manual touch with the materialities. The room was arranged so visitors could follow a path starting with reception and information about the exhibition’s construction and leading to an installation with two projectors: one displaying audiovisual works and the other showing strictly visual works, all produced in the group space.\nThere were also some artistic installations proposing reflections on themes intersecting the mental health field. A mirror installation with the famous phrase “up close, nobody is normal,” from Caetano Veloso’s song “Vaca Profana,” invited people to interact and photograph themselves. Another installation, “How to Become Uncompressed? II,” by Caio Prado, in a corner, invited people to interact by discarding empty medication blister packs, prompting reflections on the medicalization of life. Finally, we organized a collective creation space where visitors could overflow the affections of this encounter. We placed poster boards on an easel before the room exit, providing paint, colored pens, threads, and glue for composing a materiality consisting of writings, drawings, and interventions by passersby after the visit.\nThroughout the day, over 100 people visited the exhibition, including the artists and their families, users from other CAPS in Fortaleza, such as those from CAPS AD in Regional IV, health professionals, public university students, private college students, high school institutions, technical courses, and many curious individuals. The purpose was to give visibility to the artists and their works, as there was a desire in the group to exhibit, and many had never had the opportunity, while also considering how art holds an essential place of possibility when it comes to mental health care and the de-stigmatization of these individuals, positioning the city as a point of involvement.\nCities, beyond buildings, houses, and intertwined streets producing materiality, are also stages for affections and social relations (Mansano, 2016). By understanding the city as this place of intertwining, we also understand that it is where life, encounters, and discussions are produced. Madness, long imprisoned – from the 17th century, as Foucault (1975) mentions, saying that madness entered this world of exclusion by an ideal of incapacity and reconstruction of the social space of the time – must also be intertwined in this city. Going out into the world implies, therefore, a form of resistance to these historical policies of exclusion, violence, and stigmatization of these bodies.",

    "text": "Final Considerations\nPassos et al. (2021) point out that the country is advancing towards a process of (re)asylumization driven by the interest of actors representing a conservative and neoliberal political project centered on maintaining privileges and focused on privatizations and the revival of social control practices. Therefore, we observe the importance of events like the one proposed for producing materiality seen, touched, and felt, as well as for producing sensitization, reflection, and debates on the anti-asylum agenda, acting on the de-stigmatization of madness and proposing care produced in freedom.\nA Psychology that aims to be Anti-Asylum must seek, within the University, to produce knowledge articulated with the proposition of new ethical and political horizons, seeking to combat this scenario of oppression and stigma. It must, therefore, commit to fostering solutions beyond academic walls, enabling exchanges with subjects and groups often marginalized from these discussions but affected by them and creating resistances in their daily lives.\nIn this sense, we emphasize that promoting an event like this, aimed at creating displacements in the very form of producing knowledge and academic practices, was only possible from a perspective of collective work and with the different social actors forming this context. Mutual contagion of experiences, thoughts, and creations. A technical production, but also alive, launching us into new problems and concerns for our studies, research, and practices. At the interface between the University and society, we affirm an affective engagement centered on breaking rigid models of knowledge production, forming ourselves also as body-researcher-experimenters of an anti-asylum mental health and new ways of learning, caring, and living.",

    "section": "Final Considerations",
    "text": "Final Considerations\nThe Polyphonies Extension Project, through transdisciplinary and dialogical practices, seeks to disseminate scientific knowledge beyond the university, thus breaking down walls and the hierarchy of knowledge. Its activities are guided by transdisciplinarity, gaining even more strength through dialogue, which aids in the development and conduct of events, making them accessible to the general public and constructing the project collaboratively. The project’s actions focus on knowledge dissemination, understanding it as a process collectively gestated from the encounter of different subjects who have the opportunity to hear and be heard. In this sense, it can be said that Polyphonies’ ultimate goal is to contribute to social transformation by fostering and encouraging the invention of complex, rooted, and relevant knowledge addressing the issues affecting the various actors and contexts shaping societies.\nThus, the events organized by the project reflect its interest in dialogue and contact with the other, marked in their names. “Polyphonies,” “Bar Talks,” and “Clubefonia” remove the rigidity with which scientific information is typically approached, giving rise to relaxed and potent conversations, precisely because they are more than “information transfer” venues. The audience is not seen as passive; on the contrary, their thoughts, cultures, and knowledge are incorporated into the dialogue to broaden the contact and understanding of reality. Therefore, it is valid to say that Polyphonies works with the plurality of voices, ideas, people, cultures, and knowledge. Driven by the possibility of viewing the world through a transdisciplinary lens, the project seeks to learn, express, and foster this vision through its actions.\nHowever, there are challenges and room for improvement. Among the challenges, the Polyphonies team is dedicated to finding strategies to “break the bubble,” that is, to increasingly mobilize the participation of people outside the university who have access to the project and its events. In this endeavor, the group is organizing to promote the project itself through various social media (Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.), emphasizing its interest in an audience with diverse educational levels, backgrounds, and social roles.\nAnother challenge is imposed by the limitations of the virtual event environment. While it enables breaking physical barriers by bringing together individuals from different cities, it also restricts the intensity of possible interactions, particularly affecting the dialogue with the participating audience, which tends to be more passive in this scenario.\nAware of these and other difficulties, Polyphonies remains committed to its goal of enabling knowledge exchange and re-establishing the long-lost connection between science and society through its actions, bringing the community to a new place: that of a knowledge builder, thus contributing to scientific dissemination.",

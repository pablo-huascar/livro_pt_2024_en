    "text": "Introduction\nCommenting on the construction of this book means discussing a technical production. According to the latest CAPES classification (hemerly2019producao--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?), a publishing product is defined as resulting from “the processes of editing and publishing fiction and non-fiction works. It includes planning and executing, intellectually and graphically, books, encyclopedias, preparing texts, illustrations, layout, etc., linked to the Program (projects, lines, students/graduates)” (p. 41). Broadly speaking, this is what we did, and by this definition, we are well-aligned.\nThat said, it is necessary to state that producing this book was a way to free ourselves from some constraints, although we are still bound to another, not by choice, but by an institutional framework that we can at least qualify as questionable. We will return to this particular institutional constraint later.\nThe first constraint we freed ourselves from by constructing this book was that of publishers. In an analog world, where books needed to be printed and distributed for their content to be accessed, publishers played a significant role. Maintaining the necessary infrastructure for a book to go from someone’s mind to the reader was expensive, and most people who wanted to publish something could not afford the required resources. If this is true, on the other hand, the decision about what the public should read was concentrated in the hands of a few companies, and what dictated this decision was the potential commercial return of a work. There was, therefore, an oligopoly on thought.\nThis same logic applies to any other form of expression that depended on analog means and structures to be created and distributed: music, films, news, etc. However, today we live in a world where the production and transmission of information are digital. Thus, just as it is no longer necessary to have a soundboard to record or a vinyl record to materialize a phonogram, printed paper is dispensable (which does not mean it has no value). It is also no longer necessary to have a truck transporting tons of books back and forth for people to access them.\nDespite this liberation, this story, which is still ongoing, so far, does not seem to have a happy ending. Capitalism is like the Borg: it always finds a way to adapt and keeps insisting that resistance is futile. In the new world of the internet, the oligopoly of analog production and distribution by publishers, record companies, radio, and TV was replaced by that of large technology companies through streaming platforms, whether video, audio, or even books. Yes, we can create and distribute books, music, and news without intermediaries, but only those linked to the most well-known transmission platforms have a chance to appear and stand out, with rare exceptions.\nDespite this setback, the initial premise, that it is possible to create and distribute without intermediaries, is valid, can be explored, and is what we did. In this context, this book was developed with free and open-source software called Quarto, which is platform-agnostic. In our case, R and R Studio were the tools used to mediate our relationship with the documents and other files we created. Furthermore, all the code used for the book’s production is publicly available on GitHub.\nIn this new form of digital organization, we are also free from the linearity imposed by the analog medium. When we used a cassette tape, to get to the song we wanted to hear, we had to fast-forward to the point where it was. If we were watching a TV show and needed to go to the bathroom for a few moments, we would miss that crucial moment of the series where the entire plot was revealed. Today, we can even pause a live TV broadcast and return later.\nThus, in a book, we had a series of printed words and pictures and would go from page to page to where we wanted. Visually impaired people needed a Braille version to access the material autonomously. In digital versions, the book does not need to have only words or pictures, and they do not have a concrete form. In this sense, concerning visual impairment, screen readers are common and increasingly accurate, which, as long as the material is properly organized, allows it to be accessed by blind or low-vision people. Even the figures, if audio-described (and in our case, they are), can be “read.”\nIn this context, any of the chapters of this book can be accessed with a click, and there is a search tool to find terms or concepts one wishes to retrieve. Since we do not only need to have words, we can, for example, place videos wherever we wish and blocks for people to execute R codes. Here are some examples of how the possibility of bringing together various media in a single space was utilized in this production:\nThese are examples of what can be done, and as researchers better understand these intersection possibilities, much more can be articulated. There is a universe of creativity to be explored.\nThe third constraint does not depend solely on technological means to be freed from. It depends on a political struggle to rethink scientific production in Brazil, especially the ways of evaluating graduate programs, granting scholarships, and funding researchers. I have heard from more than one sensible voice that Einstein would never have an approved project in Brazil. Over the years, a neoliberal managerial logic has taken over Brazilian education at all levels and seems to have taken root in evaluation mechanisms.\nThe formula is very similar to the financialization that has taken over companies: only the quarterly profit for dividend distribution and to increase managers’ bonuses matters. Immediate profitability must come at any cost, even if it means making cuts that will take away innovation possibilities and, in the long run, render the company uncompetitive in the market.\nIn graduate studies, what we see is: publish massively, even if they are absolutely irrelevant products, but that score points in the miraculously elaborated evaluation tables. The more you do this, the more access to resources and “prestige in the field” you will have, to perhaps someday do what you truly believe needs to be done.\nObviously, we are not saying that all production is irrelevant; there are numerous innovations and discoveries that emerge amidst this perverse logic, but the caricature serves to show the path this model leads us down. With this caveat made, in the long run, it is necessary to denounce that this scoring table model applied to graduate studies can make scientific production voluminous but without any impact, whether in basic science, where we simply want to understand how the universe works, or in the attempt to solve the numerous problems the country faces.\nThis model already has by-products: the trade in participation in collection books, whose advertisements claim to be “compliant with Qualis CAPES,” and perhaps even more ethically questionable, the sale of co-authorship in chapters. If the game is to score points, what’s the problem with selling points to those who want or need them? The logic is simple: pay, publish, and score.\nAnd what do we do? We invent a pretty name to avoid going to the root of the problem: they are “predatory” publishers and journals. We will make endless lists to put them on our academic vanity bonfire, proclaim to the four winds that these practices need to be combated, and continue avoiding the discussion that really matters, which is to ask ourselves why the evaluation has this purely quantitative character based on questionable scoring criteria. There are ‘qualitative’ elements in the evaluation forms, but, in the end, it is the volume of “well-scored” production that counts, and the competition between programs is the basis of the evaluation system.\nIn this sense, we will not criticize the people who organize and make money from this trade, even if the practice is morally questionable (tell us something in capitalism that isn’t?), nor the people who participate in it, because they are not the cause of the problem but the most obvious consequence of the model we are questioning. We will not criticize, but we have to ask ourselves: does anyone believe in the relevance of most of the “knowledge” generated in this academic fruit market? And this market arises from the managerial model that needs to create scoring tables to say who is more or who is less in this four-yearly ranking of graduate programs.\nA small addendum to show how this spreads throughout Brazilian education. Something similar happens in basic education when looking at large-scale assessments, a U.S. proposal that has already proven flawed there, but which is still treated with deference here due to the enormous influence that private foundations linked to large corporate groups have on educational policies. Several municipalities display advertisements showing the scores that municipalities and schools obtained in the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB). Political opponents will accuse managers of fraud to get the scores, but in many cases, there is no fraud in the sense they are accusing.\nThe fraud lies in treating education as training children to solve Portuguese and math tests, the only subjects evaluated. This leads to what is called curriculum narrowing (gesqui2015estreitamento--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?; rubio2020avaliacao--2473e96bc614a911821242119918a241a41836d6?), where all other subjects are relegated to second place. There are cases where history, geography, and any other subject teachers are pressured to teach the topics that will be covered in external assessments and abandon their content. If we think about it, even Portuguese and math are sidelined because they themselves do not matter, but rather the children’s ability to solve the tests. Critical thinking, citizenship, scientific education, for what? What I need is to advertise how high the municipality’s score was.\nTranslating this statement to graduate studies: cutting-edge scientific production, solving the country’s problems, making discoveries about the universe, for what? What I need is to score, score, and score to reach the Olympus of grade 7. In both cases, what has this brought positive to society? Nobody cares because what is at stake is the quarterly result to distribute dividends to shareholders and give bonuses to managers. In this logic, the long term is for those who like to philosophize and not for those who like to make money or score.\nHere, another addendum: will we criticize those who play the game as it is set? Never! People are trying to survive in this jungle of competition that this evaluation model has created and are workers with precarious working conditions who, in the midst of all this, try to do something relevant for the world. What we can do is invite them to reflection and engagement in the struggle for better working conditions, which involves a profound change in how scientific production is evaluated in Brazil. Did you think we ourselves would abandon this game because there is no way? You thought wrong…! The first thing capitalism condemns us to is fatalism, and we will not surrender to it.\nAs we said before, we purposely caricature the path of scientific irrelevance to which this model leads, but we recognize the struggle of teachers and researchers to produce high-level knowledge in a country that treats science and technology as something subordinate. If here we make the denunciation, it is not against the workers, but against the capitalist system that intertwined its financial logic in the management and evaluation of graduate studies and proclaims the end of history, as if nothing else were possible beyond the deepening of this perverse model.",

    "text": "Introduction\nThis chapter aims to report the experiences of creating podcasts, as communication products, by VIESES: Group of Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation, between 2020 and 2021, as strategies for dialogical production and sharing knowledge about Psychology, human rights, and contemporary socio-psychological processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. This laboratory is part of the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).\nThe COVID-19 pandemic brought several challenges to the academic activities of VIESES, which, since its creation, occurred through the insertion and joint composition in peripheral territories of Fortaleza. With the implementation of emergency remote activities at UFC to ensure physical distancing for the prevention of COVID-19 infections, it was necessary to reinvent formative strategies that maintained the dialogical ethos of our knowledge production in Psychology, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels (Barros et al., 2023).\nThe experiences of creating 4 podcasts by VIESES within this context will be reported: Presentemente, #TraçandoVáriosPlanos, Artes Insurgentes, and Café da Tarde. The goal of these initiatives was for knowledge production, in a scenario of extreme fragility in guaranteeing rights, to act politically for visibility, articulation, and production of other channels of listening to an insurgent psychology (Barros et al., 2019). The aim was, above all, to act against the historical-social logics of oppression, aggravated by the pandemic context, and to serve as a tool that blurs hegemonic boundaries of knowledge construction, using cybernetic tools to overcome these challenges.",

    "text": "Presentemente Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe Presentemente podcast, whose name is inspired by the song “Sujeito de Sorte” by singer Belchior, was created in 2020 with the aim of pluralizing and resonating discussions about the present from critical and diverse perspectives on topics pertinent to the field of human rights, valuing practices of resistance and ways of staying “sane, safe, and strong.” The project was made possible by a VIESES team composed of undergraduate students and a faculty advisor, involving topic selection, contacting guests1, script creation, editing, posting episodes on podcast aggregators, and promoting artwork on social media. The discussions in each episode are conducted by people affected in various ways by the topic, either from experience in social movements, academic productions, or life experiences, aiming to diversify the debates and elucidate various perspectives. Each episode, averaging 50 minutes, was released biweekly on Thursdays between July and October 2020. The first season of the podcast consists of six episodes. The titles covered, in order of publication, were: “Hatred and Cancellation Today,” “Racism and Anti-Racist Struggle,” “Peripheries and Poetic Re-Existences,” “LGBTQIA+ Lives and LGBTFOBIA,” and “Childhoods in Brazil.” The season finale was an extra episode titled “Mental Health and Youth from the Periphery: Psychosocial Distress and Care Production in the Pandemic Context,” resulting from a podcast episode submitted to the XI International Symposium on Brazilian Youth (JUBRA) held in December 2020.\nThe second season of the Presentemente podcast is still in progress. Four episodes have been released, from July to September 2021, on the themes of “Arts and Peripheries on the Agenda” and “Cultural Appropriation and Colonialities,” with the third and fourth episodes being two parts of the same conversation titled “Indigenous Peoples in Brazil.”",

    "text": "#TraçandoVáriosPlanos Podcast\n\n\n\n\nThe #TraçandoVáriosPlanos podcast, which dialogues with the song “Sulamericano” by the Bahian musical group BaianaSystem, focuses on Social Psychology and Political Psychology readings on contemporary socio-psychological themes and processes. More than 14 episodes were released between 2020 and 2021, across the first two seasons. The production of #TraçandoVáriosPlanos always involves the participation of the advising professor or teaching internship students in the presentation, as well as guests from the academic context. All episodes, averaging 40 minutes, are available for free on YouTube on the Pós-PsicologiaS UFC channel and also on Spotify.\nThe released episodes covered themes such as: “Psychosocial Aspects of Violence and Social Psychology”; “Neoliberalism and the Necroeconomy of Punishment: Racism, Mass Incarceration, and Pandemic Impacts”; “Social Psychology and Hate Speech Today”; “Critical Criminology, Feminist Criminology, and the Problem of Punitive Penal Selectivity”; “Neoliberal Subjectivation and Social Psychology”; “Social Transformations of Violence and Prison Dynamics: The Case of Ceará”; “Beyond Prison: Alternative Penal Policy or Alternative to Penal Policy?”; “Intersectionality, Production of Subjectivities, and Social Psychology”; “Gender and Subjectivity from Feminist Studies”; and “Can the White Listen? – Reflections on Whiteness”; “Social Psychology and Inequalities in the COVID-19 Pandemic”; “Psychology and Extremisms Today”; “Psychosocial Aspects of Racism and Anti-Racist Psychology”; and “Denialism and the Public Dimension of Mourning in the Pandemic: Connections Between Subjectivity and Politics.”\nIn 2022, a special season on Psychology and Human Rights was produced. Its 12 episodes came from panels held during an extension course on this theme promoted by VIESES in 2021.\n#TraçandoVáriosPlanos has proven to be an important strategy for maintaining and enhancing the connection of students with the Psychology course at UFC by offering learning and reflection alternatives in the face of reality and challenges posed by social distancing, being fundamental to expanding the reach of themes debated by VIESES far beyond its student body through new communication and information tools.",

Aimed at encouraging insurgent practices and strengthening the cultural memory of urban peripheries by enhancing the artistic-cultural expressions of youth collectives from the neighborhoods of Grande Bom Jardim (GBJ), in Fortaleza-CE2, the project has shown a significant social role in peripheral territories, especially with students from public schools and members of youth collectives from GBJ. Since the first semester of 2021, one of the project’s action fronts has been producing a podcast to disseminate and dialogue with members of actions, activities, and projects within youth collectives that fight for rights in GBJ and use art as a tool of struggle, from various artistic language expressions, such as visual arts, literature, music, dance, and theater.\nSo far, the podcast, titled “Artes Insurgentes: Collectivizing Resistances,” has three episodes ranging from 20 to 50 minutes, available on Spotify. The first episode consists of a presentation of the project and its proposals; the second episode addresses issues related to the 2021 Youth Festival and its repercussions for the local scene; and the third episode, the most recent, discusses actions taken by the Specialized Technical Articulation Nucleus (Narte) of the Bom Jardim Cultural Center and its resonances in the GBJ community.\nIn 2022, the first episode of the Artes Insurgentes podcast, titled “Resistances and Alliances in the Breaks,” was released, addressing how residents of the Grande Bom Jardim region participated in political and social movements related to combating violence and fighting for human rights in their territories in the city.",

Aiming to promote welcoming actions at the university in times of weakened ties and attacks on public education, the Café da Tarde podcast sought to constitute, in the virtual environment, exchanges where everyday affections, student experiences, affective places, and processes of invention and sharing were invoked as forms of alliance and resistance to discouragement, understood as the political sentiment of our time.\nThe conversations included the following triggering themes: the university in times of remote learning, inventive ways of doing extension when it is not possible to be “in the field”; the implications and challenges of conducting research during the current health crisis; and the creative process of the podcast as a UFC project. The 12 guests were undergraduate and graduate students from the UFC Psychology course. The podcast was carried out by undergraduate students and the advising professor from VIESES. We highlight that the search for a sound and visual aesthetic (posts to promote the podcast) that allowed for erasures, intervals, silences, and interruptions was an ethical-aesthetic-political bet against neoliberal and productivity-driven models in Brazilian higher education. Not only that, it was a way to inhabit the virtual territory in the face of the imminent massification of distance education strategies within the university as a horizon of control over teaching-learning processes.",

    "section": "Final Considerations",
    "text": "Final Considerations\nThe above-listed communication products are contemporary productions that effectively address Psychology through collective and engaged technical production with social movements, productions that resonate their practices and impact the practice of Psychology, expanding content, debate, and involving communities, faculty, and students. Thus, modes of knowledge production are reinvented, encouraging and valuing practices that highlight challenges and impasses in the decolonization of Psychology (Miranda & Félix-Silva, 2022).\nThe creation of these technical productions, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of neo-fascist values and practices, started from the premise that addressing the multifaceted field of Human Rights through innovative strategies that broaden the reach and resonance of technical productions in Psychology is fundamental for promoting critical training in this area, linking undergraduate and graduate studies, ethically committed to transforming unequal realities in the Brazilian context, which still coexists with strong marks and practices of coloniality (Ballestrin, 2013; Lugones, 2014). To move against uncritical and reductionist approaches on the subject, the communication products could address realities and theoretical references of thinkers in Psychology and related fields that problematize cis-hetero-patriarchal-colonial-capitalist patterns (Silva et al., 2023).\nWe believe that these technical productions linked to VIESES are relevant for enhancing, strengthening, and stimulating reflections and experience reports on tackling inequalities, violence, and oppression in Brazil (Benicio et al., 2018). Furthermore, they have sought to contribute, within the scope of emergency remote teaching, to meeting society’s demands for elucidating sociopsychological aspects of violence and sharing successful experiences in defending human rights. These products have innovation potential, as they sought to create more interactive channels for discussion, re-elaboration, and dissemination of knowledge produced by VIESES-UFC research. The number of editions also shows the potential for replicating actions. The fact that the podcasts have been accessed by people in various countries shows their international reach. The articulations between undergraduate, graduate students, faculty, professionals, and members of social movements, as well as the need for the team to appropriate methods and techniques of curation, scripting, editing, and dissemination, demonstrate the high complexity of such technical productions.\nTherefore, it is believed that these communication products contribute to expanding the impact of the Graduate Program in Psychology at UFC on society by enhancing the resonances of discussions that have been dear to VIESES since its creation. This is because, with the podcasts, these problematizations could reach from undergraduate and graduate students to professionals, whether in Psychology or related fields, to public policy managers and members of collectives, social movements, and civil society organizations from different regions of Brazil and even beyond the national territory.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nMuch has been discussed about the apparent gap between scientific knowledge and society. During the pandemic1, and even before it, we observed a resurgence of anti-scientific manifestations such as anti-vaccine movements, the return of flat earth beliefs, and the use of unproven medications for disease treatment. Similarly, institutions producing academic knowledge, such as schools, universities, and scientific communicators, have not succeeded in maintaining a dialogue with society. Often, the language used does not facilitate communication, and the use of jargon incomprehensible to the majority of the “lay” population creates an insurmountable barrier for those outside the academic sphere. While technical teaching still prevails in the academic environment, transdisciplinarity and dialogue emerge as a way to bridge academic-scientific knowledge with reality, cultural experiences, and individuals’ knowledge, allowing for enrichment and learning fundamental for the improvement of both dimensions without denying their specificities.\nThis chapter aims to present aspects that traverse and compose the Polyphonies extension project, highlighting both its practices, which generally characterize as a technical production of the “Event Organization” type, and the main theoretical guidelines that underpin them. To this end, the chapter is subdivided into 2 sections, respectively:\nAt the end, besides concisely revisiting the discussed points, some challenges for improving Polyphonies activities are listed.",

    "section": "Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project",
    "text": "Getting to Know the Polyphonies Project\nPolyphonies is an extension project of the Federal University of Ceará – Sobral Campus, which is based on the importance of transversal, transdisciplinary, decolonized, and transformative teaching that transcends the university’s barriers. Only through the democratization of knowledge is it possible to contribute to mitigating vulnerabilities, training more ethical professionals aware of their responsibility to the general community, and ensuring that different social actors actively participate in knowledge production. Thus, Polyphonies’ main objective is to disseminate scientific and philosophical knowledge using simple and accessible language that facilitates the approach and dialogue between academic and non-academic audiences.\nAlthough it was registered with the Extension Pro-Rectory only in January 2020, the project originated from a meeting held on October 31, 2019, in the Mucambinho auditorium (UFC/Sobral). The event featured the participation of four PhD professors affiliated with UFC/Sobral to discuss the topic of “Time” from the perspectives of Music, with Dr. Adeline Stervinou; Physics, with Dr. João Guilherme Matias Nogueira; Engineering, with Dr. José Cláudio do Nascimento; and Anthropology, with Dr. Denise Silva. Despite the high level of the guests, they were asked to address the topic in a comprehensible and engaging way for an audience that included students and professors from various undergraduate and graduate courses. Each guest had between 10 and 15 minutes to speak, followed by an open session for audience comments and questions.\nThe event was very successful, with an estimated participation of 80 to 90 people, and it was evident that everyone (guests and audience) was interested in exchanging ideas and making transdisciplinary connections in a setting where informality and scientific rigor were perfectly balanced. Professors and students from seemingly different courses such as Music, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Psychology engaged in deep and productive dialogues, momentarily forgetting their supposed disciplinary separation. The event’s receptiveness was so strong that students, guests, and professors approached the organizers afterward to suggest other dialogue topics, demonstrating their desire for the activity’s continuity. Consequently, plans began to take shape to ensure the event’s regular occurrence and expand its reach beyond the university’s walls.\nOnce registered with the proper authorities, the project’s coordinators sought, in early March 2020, to establish a partnership with the Sobral Municipal Education Secretariat (SEDUC). The search for SEDUC was not random but reflected Polyphonies’ commitment to extending beyond the university audience, provoking debates where multiple perspectives on a topic could flow. According to the plan, guests and school communities in basic education would have the chance to jointly create an environment for exchanges where the rigid marking of power and knowledge places would be continuously challenged.\nSEDUC embraced the partnership proposal, understanding that it would bring to the municipality a relevant experience of transdisciplinary and dialogical practices in the regular school environment; a stimulus for studying subjects and curriculum content and academic reading through transdisciplinary topics that provoke logical and complex reasoning in an accessible manner, among other benefits. In return, the secretariat would assist in promoting the events within the school community, providing physical space and/or transportation to the event location, and financial support for publications derived from each meeting. However, on March 16, 2020, Sobral declared its first period of social isolation due to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus pandemic, postponing the developing plans with SEDUC until the health situation returned to normal.\nIt was then up to the newly formed Polyphonies team – 2 coordinating professors and 6 undergraduate students – like many other activities in various sectors, to reinvent planned actions for in-person delivery while maintaining the project’s central aspects and ensuring everyone’s health and safety. Considering the available possibilities and existing examples, the group opted to hold meetings online. Social networks and their popularity among different audiences emerged as a potentially interesting tool for achieving the project’s goals under the imposed health scenario. The apparent simplicity of social networks, their reach, and the speed of content dissemination made them the primary source for promoting the 7 events that subsequently took place. Instagram, initially a photo-sharing social network, became for many a professional dissemination tool, for quick tutorials, and news. Thus, it was a virtual space suitable for the mobilizations and contacts desired by the project.\nThe Polyphonies project account on Instagram was created on May 30, 2020, as a place that gathered information about the project and its activities, also serving as a virtual interaction space with interested audiences, currently having 287 followers. Over time and with the team’s maturation, the page also became a receptacle for posts with suggestions for artistic productions (series, books, films, and music) related to the theme of the most recent event. The choice of art was justified as an effective, democratic, and inviting dissemination form for the general public, mainly because its language is open to diverse views and subjectivity (Gomes, 2020). Additionally, introducing art in dialogical mediation with the project’s audience generated an initially unexpected product: Clubefonias, an action that gathers people of different age groups and realities via WhatsApp to discuss a work chosen by the members in biweekly meetings.\nBesides the Instagram page and the Clubefonias WhatsApp group, the project created a YouTube channel in August 2020 that hosts the recorded events. On this widely accessible social network, 3 of the 7 organized meetings are available.\nOn June 16, 2020, the first virtual event took place via Google Meet, bringing together university professors with experience in Art, Philosophy, and Psychology and a representative of an African-based religion to discuss the theme “All Roads Lead to Knowledge.” The theme was chosen by the Polyphonies team to introduce the project’s proposal to the general public without appearing as a lecture and without imposing a limited way of thinking about knowledge. The idea was to indicate openness to dialogue and the project’s transdisciplinary nature through the event title. During registration for the “live,” participants were invited to suggest topics for future discussions, thus seeking to access their interests and realities. The event had 86 registrants, lasted 2 hours, and certificates were issued for guests and participants.\nA few days after the inaugural event, the project team met to collectively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses to be improved in future actions. This moment proved essential and has since been incorporated into the extension group’s meeting schedule. As a result of these event analyses, some modifications or action guidelines were implemented: ensuring space for audience questions/comments within the event time; reducing the meeting duration from 2 hours to 1 hour, considering the excess of virtual activities since the pandemic; decreasing the number of guests to 2 per session; creating 3 guiding questions distributed to the guests upon invitation, facilitating communication between different perspectives and their connection to everyday concerns; rotating the student team members as event moderators, as this contributes to their professional development; intensifying event promotion via WhatsApp and other means to reach more people outside the university; changing the event’s name from “Round Table Discussion” to “Bar Talk.”\nThe choice of the name “Bar Talk” deserves special attention, as it is linked to understanding that the “role of scientific dissemination has evolved over time, following the development of science and technology” (Albagli, 1996). In times of fast communication and social networks, it was considered important to adapt the name to the type of event held by Polyphonies. While “Round Table Discussion” conveys a dialogical and informal disposition, it also carries the image of an academic action common within school and university walls. However, “Bar Talk” evokes a space not associated with the scientific universe, and thus, it not only highlights the informality of the conversation and dialogue but also suggests active participation where discussions are accessible and stimulating. By distancing the events from a scientific dissemination praxis characterized by the difficulties of transmitting knowledge that academic and scientific circles display, the project reinforces openness to dialogue with other types of audiences and the opportunity to engage with various topics. Thus, scientific dissemination assumes essential roles in democratizing scientific knowledge and, consequently, opens doors to scientific literacy, contributing to including citizens in specialized topic debates that, even without many knowing, are intrinsically linked to and influence their lives (Bueno, 2010), as well as adding to the education of so-called ‘intellectuals’ by giving them the chance to expand/exercise new languages and articulations from their expertise.\nIt is worth noting that the internal meetings of the Polyphonies team, held biweekly on Fridays, are important not only due to the “technical” decisions that arise from them. In fact, the group’s meetings have served as a way to foster light and creative connections among participants, as most members did not have the chance to strengthen bonds in person, given that the pandemic began shortly after they joined the team. Approaching people virtually was the main challenge faced by the project, but the group’s internal experience has been a successful example of how dialogical thinking and practice combined with transdisciplinarity are potent for building humanized and enriching social bonds.\nBetween March 16, 2020, and August 2021, when this chapter was written, Polyphonies conducted 7 events, bringing together 298 participants, including 16 guests (11 from academic backgrounds and 5 from non-academic backgrounds). In addition to the topic of the first meeting, already described, the subjects addressed were: Pandemic and family relationships; Contemporary work relationships; Art and social transformation; Fake news and its impacts on society; Social movements; Language – Norms, power, and social transformations. These themes, whenever possible, took into account the suggestions presented by the audience during event registration. To date, the project has recorded 17 topics brought by participants.\nDespite this predominantly informative and practical description of the Polyphonies project, it is only possible to truly understand it by illuminating, albeit briefly, the theoretical and ethical pillars underlying its actions. This is the purpose of the next section.",

    "text": "Theoretical and Ethical Pillars of Polyphonies\n\nTransdisciplinarity\nTransdisciplinarity is understood as what is, at the same time, between, through, and beyond any discipline. The term, according to Guedes (2010), was first used by Piaget in 1970 but was only formalized in 1994 with the document “Charter of Transdisciplinarity” at the First World Congress in Portugal. Transdisciplinarity seeks to “transgress the logic of non-contradiction, articulating opposites: subject and object, subjectivity and objectivity, matter and consciousness, simplicity and complexity, unity and diversity” (Nicolescu, 1999; Santos, 2008). In other words, transdisciplinarity understands that reality can be viewed integratively, blurring the boundaries between forms of knowledge and asserting that the whole – reality – is highly complex and integrated, and the parts – sciences, for instance – actively communicate and sustain each other. This approach breaks with the fixed and timeless idea of dichotomies, understanding them as interactive agents that must be considered from the relationships they establish among themselves. Thus, Santos (2008) states that “the understanding of reality ascends to another level, taking on a broader meaning and always open to new processes” (p. 5).\nA serious analysis of the history of science reveals the transdisciplinary dimension of science, as scientific knowledge and society are intimately intertwined. The formation and consolidation of science point to a specific way of responding to society’s questions and needs (Videira, 2004).\nBeyond this social rootedness, which shows that science is not external to the world, it is important to apply the transdisciplinary perspective to the very structure of science. While the departmentalization of science allows for undeniable advances through highly specialized studies, discoveries in each field and subfield of knowledge need to be repositioned within the complex web of reality that is not abstractly fragmented into study fields. In this sense, it is fundamental to recognize scientific knowledge as constituted by diverse professionals with diverse knowledges that relate and intersect. Thus, transdisciplinarity, by not disregarding the complex aspects of reality and valuing its multiplicity, enhances dialogue between science and society and between different spheres of scientific knowledge.\nFrom this perspective, Martinazzo (2020) suggests that transdisciplinarity is a better path to understanding a complex and multidimensional reality, as it uses mechanisms that enable adaptation to this multiplicity. Transdisciplinarity, by considering both the complex and the simple to comprehend reality, allows various fields to be contemplated in knowledge as they articulate in the world, making room for opposing ideas to be considered and for all fields of knowledge to exercise their importance.\nTransdisciplinarity aims to overcome the closed universe produced by science by bringing forth the multiplicity of knowledge production modes and recognizing the importance of reintegrating the subject into the scientific observation process, given the strong interdependence between the observer, the observation process, and the observed object (Martinazzo, 2020, p. 7).\nThus, transdisciplinarity, in its pursuit of knowledge reintegration and the subject’s participation in scientific production, also facilitates the broader dissemination of knowledge, especially in societies where knowledge diffusion is often hindered by social inequalities, highlighting the elitist nature of knowledge access in these cultures. Indeed, this rapprochement is built because transdisciplinary practice strengthens the democratization of scientific knowledge by considering that this knowledge is produced for society and recognizing that non-scientific knowledge is relevant for understanding the world. Additionally, transdisciplinarity is linked to scientific dissemination, as it adapts to the complex and multidimensional reality, values contextualization, and creates an environment where divergent ideas and practices have the opportunity to be confronted respectfully and rigorously. Thus, transdisciplinarity fosters the dialogue essential for democratizing knowledge and genuinely democratic and free societies.\nHaving outlined the qualities and potentials of transdisciplinarity, the question remains: how can we promote transdisciplinary practices from the Brazilian university setting?\nClues to answering this question lie in the previously mentioned definition of transdisciplinarity, indicating the need to flexibilize knowledge boundaries through an integrated understanding of reality. Based on this, for scientific knowledge dissemination to occur, it is essential to devise strategies that ensure the traversal of physical and social barriers to knowledge access without neglecting the inherent possibilities of contemporary technologies. This is the arena where the Polyphonies Project operates with its events and actions.\nThe project’s actions aim to address various contemporary issues from a contextualized and multifaceted perspective, understanding that even the simplest topic carries a multiplicity of information studied from plural theoretical and practical perspectives. Because they are plural, they can be approached from different references, giving the topic a transdisciplinary character. Let’s take the first event, “All Roads Lead to Knowledge,” as an example. As mentioned earlier, the meeting featured 4 guests, including 3 university professors (linked to Art, Psychology, and/or Philosophy) and a religious representative. On this occasion, each guest spoke about a type of knowledge related to their field (Art, Philosophy, Science, and Religion), highlighting not only their specificities but also their relationships with the other represented spheres. The event’s transdisciplinary goal was successful, as the intertwined speeches of the guests effectively broke the traditional barriers between those knowledge fields, and the audience’s participation through comments and questions gave/amplified the meaning of what was discussed while simultaneously glimpsing interaction points in the diverse speakers’ discourses. In this first activity, the strength and, consequently, the need for transdisciplinary practices in scientific and non-scientific fields became evident as tools for enhancing the dissemination of knowledge integrated with society.\n\n\nScientific Dissemination\nDiscussing scientific dissemination requires revisiting a few centuries to consider the very act of doing science. As highlighted by Moreira (2002, Novembro 14-15), the known scientific revolution occurred in the mid-17th century, influenced by various sociodemographic factors, bringing to the forefront many thinkers who are now scientific references, such as Kepler and Galileo. However, despite the growing recognition of scientific relevance and the development of technologies that expanded access to intellectual products, science remains in the hands of specific and small groups – albeit significantly larger and more diverse than in previous centuries – while most of the population remains ignorant of the scientific and technological knowledge production processes underlying the presented ways of life.\nAs previously mentioned, despite the many knowledge produced within research centers and university academies, their connection with the external public leaves much to be desired. The dissemination of what is produced usually does not reach those outside the scientific sphere, even though this seems to occur unintentionally, as nothing indicates that researchers are interested in this segregation. The problem of poor knowledge distribution has already concerned Lima Vaz (2000), who emphasized:\n\nThe great scientific revolutions of our century, while propelling technical progress, make the understanding of deep theoretical connections between scientific thought and technical practice more enigmatic to the common man, user of the objects that technology offers for his consumption and satisfaction. (p. 278).\n\nOne consequence of this poor knowledge distribution can be seen in today’s anti-scientific movements, which, using resources that only exist due to the development of science and technology, propagate distorted and false information that fuels unfounded conspiracy theories with potentially devastating effects in politics, health, economy, environment, etc.\nThis reveals the urgency of rethinking the ways in which scientific knowledge dissemination has occurred – or failed to occur. More than ever, creating spaces where science and society can interact fluidly is essential. A fluid interaction capable of effectively disseminating academic knowledge requires always remembering that the audience addressed by the knowledge will consist of “lay” people. This implies considering not only the dissemination medium but also the language used.\nTraditionally, sciences adopt a discourse type aimed at knowledge diffusion to a restricted audience. Thus, scientific communication among peers does not usually need to make concessions in its specialized discourse, as despite using restricted language, it finds its primary interlocutor in a very specific audience familiar with that vocabulary and data presentation form. However, when aiming to expand beyond those groups versed in academic jargon, scientists and intellectuals usually act believing, as Bueno (2010) points out, “that their audience shares the same concepts and that technical jargon constitutes common heritage” (p. 3). However, presuming that the chosen words for the discourse already carry specific meanings and functions cannot be dissociated from the notion that these meanings and functions take shape through contact with the listener. Therefore, in contact with individuals outside the scientific environment, words requiring a conception restricted to researchers’ circles do not convey meanings (Authier-Revuz, 2015) and undermine the dissemination effort.\nIn this context, Polyphonies aims to practice scientific dissemination, understanding it as a process of recoding specialized discourse to make content accessible to a broad audience (Bueno, 2010), an effort to translate and decode information shaped in academic-scientific codes and jargon into more familiar language understandable by the scientifically uneducated public (Bueno, 2010). The project assumes that knowledge dissemination is appropriate in “any activity of explaining and spreading knowledge, culture, and scientific and technical thought, under two conditions: outside official or equivalent education and without the aim of training specialists” (Marandino et al., 2003, p. 5), and, based on this, proposes a colloquial conversation among different actors related to the selected event theme. In this interaction, driven by questions previously sent to the guests, researchers, practitioners (professionals, social movement participants, etc.), and the public have the chance to adjust and expand their different vocabularies, collectively weaving a glossary that harmonizes theories, practices, and experiences. Thus, the commitment to scientific dissemination results in a commitment to dialogue as a core pillar of Polyphonies.\n\n\nDialogue\nWith the idea of dialogism, Mikhail Bakhtin shed light on the dialogical interactions that constitute and are woven between discourses, asserting that the dialogical relationship is constitutive of language (Marcuzzo, 2008; Rechdan, 2003). According to him, humans must always be seen in their relationship with others, as “it is impossible to think of a person outside the relationships that bind them to others” (Faraco, 1996, as cited in Marcuzzo, 2008, p. 4). Thus, the dialogical dimension is not only present in language and discourses but continuously traverses our identity. Despite this foundational intertwining that links self and other, establishing dialogical relationships where one voice does not submit to others is not guaranteed a priori. Here, the notion of polyphony comes into play, pointing to a dialogical movement where “different social voices … confront each other, clash, manifesting different social viewpoints on a given object …” (Rechdan, 2003, p. 46). This concept aptly names the project: Polyphonies activities mobilize diverse social voices, creating an environment where distinct discourses have the opportunity to cross and consciously redraw themselves, recognizing their identities are not static or independent of their connection to the other.\nAs seen in the transdisciplinarity section, the project embraces the notion that knowledge construction operates multiply and constantly, encompassing different aspects that are shaped, transformed, or cease to be validated as they relate. This aligns with the idea that reality is complex, i.e., it does not have only one level, one side, one knowledge, all comprehensible definitively. From this angle, the hierarchicalization of knowledge or certain areas as less or more important loses a priori significance, as the engine and validation of knowledge are understood as inseparable from the flow of knowledge, experiences, and consequences at play.\nPolyphonies’ journey seeks to keep in mind that not only reality but also the individuals inhabiting and composing it are complex. Thus, in pursuing its commitment to having a transformative effect on the world, the project considers individuals as bearers of histories, experiences, and worldviews (Lucena et al., 2016). Accordingly, Paulo Freire (2008) is an indispensable reference, understanding that “dialogue is, in itself, creative and re-creative” [and that] “dialogue seals the act of learning, which is never individual, although it has an individual dimension” (pp. 13-14). Adopting Freire’s view, Polyphonies strives to convene, through dialogue, individuals as creative subjects endowed with unique riches, whose action/inaction impacts reality. By embedding dialogue as a core part of its activities, the project reinforces the idea that knowledge is a product of the collective of subjects who, consciously or not, invent and reinvent the world.\nTherefore, considering scientific dissemination through dialogical lenses reaffirms the previously discussed need to subvert conventional relationships with language to create diverse spaces where words make sense for everyone. This task is especially challenging in a country with high social inequality and income concentration, requiring serious consideration that in formal lectures, congresses, or even classrooms, the language used can include or exclude subjects who have historically had their knowledge denied and erased by the imposition of a hegemonic culture, including scientific theories and institutions.\nChauí (2002) invites us to take the next step, recalling that “democracy brings to the fore the problem of violence, that is, the reduction of the subject to the condition of a thing” (p. 68). In other words, by adopting dialogue as a form of scientific dissemination, Polyphonies is not simply concerned with the cosmetic dimension of language, making it palatable and accessible to those outside the academic milieu. More than that, the project’s events aim to value the myriad ways individuals produce, signify, and narrate cultures and knowledge.\nThus, Polyphonies’ actions counter a ‘colonizing mission,’ whose project was to homogenize the world, obliterating cultural differences. Through deeply anti-democratic and anti-dialogical colonization, much social experience was wasted, and the world’s epistemological, cultural, and political diversity was reduced. Those who managed to survive colonizing advances were subjected to the dominant epistemological norm (Santos, 2008).\nBy establishing dialogue as an inescapable guideline for its activities, Polyphonies acknowledges the existence of a coloniality of knowledge and positions itself against it. Admitting that speech implies power relations means not shying away from repeatedly asking: Who speaks? To whom does one speak? About what does one speak? How does one speak? Which discursive practices are being denied, and which are being legitimized? Whom does this discourse serve?\nAsking these questions and being committed to revisiting them regularly outlines the project’s ethical horizon, prompting its members to continually think of ways to create spaces where knowledge can circulate dialogically, where all voices matter, and where scientific dissemination is effective precisely because the walls separating scientific knowledge from popular knowledge can be collectively redrawn.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "What Moves Thought to Think\nThe work we present here originates from our commitment to building a society without asylums. From a Deleuzian perspective that “more important than thought is what ‘gives one to think’…” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 89), we were driven by this struggle to create devices that articulated what was experienced in contact with our field of intervention, namely a Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS), and the production and dissemination of knowledge, in an attempt to invent spaces, beyond academic activity, that enable the deconstruction of the stigma of madness.\nThe production of knowledge constructed in/through immersion in the field relies on the perspective of the tension that the insertion of bodies in a given territory exerts, as it drives the construction of new knowledge, practices, and experiments. Referencing cartography as a research method and access to reality, according to Barros and Kastrup (2009), the cartographer opens up to the movement of a territory and unravels variables of a production process in this contact.\nIn this sense, the experience of organizing an event in honor of the National Day of the Anti-Asylum Struggle emerges as a significant technical production, enabling reflection on constructing engaged and embodied knowledge that extends beyond classrooms and academic walls. Organized by the PASÁRGADA group: Promotion of Art, Health, and Guarantee of Rights, linked to the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Psychology at the Federal University of Ceará (UFC), Fortaleza campus, in partnership with the substitute service, other groups, and social movements, the Anti-Asylum Week, held in 2022, constituted an event aiming to engage the community in defending care in freedom, based on the need to irradiate a new social vision affirming madness in the sphere of coexistence, with free circulation in the city’s fabric.\nIn this venture, we started with a perspective that conceives defending the rights of people in psychological distress as a social transformation project that goes beyond the physical extinction of asylums and all societal mechanisms of exclusion and silencing of madness, understanding that “the asylum issue echoes far beyond the psychiatric hospital walls or the strict domain of asylum practices, extending throughout the social fabric” (Prado Filho & Lemos, 2020, p. 55). In other words, the production of this event stems from the idea that resisting the asylum system requires contaminating the streets, challenging the thoughts of those entrenched in oppressive and exclusionary perspectives on madness and difference.\nWith Deleuze (2003), we learned that “without something that forces one to think, without something that violates thought, it means nothing” (p. 89). Thus, to provoke thought beyond what is prescribed by common sense, it is necessary to create a state of strangeness, always involuntary, that breaks the mere recognition of the external world, which is provoked by signs: “what forces us to think is the sign. The sign is the object of an encounter; but it is precisely the contingency of the encounter that guarantees the necessity of what it makes us think” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 91).\nThinking is, therefore, an activity triggered involuntarily under the violence of encountering signs, which should not be confused with signifiers, as signs have no pre-given meaning to be recognized. Instead, “the sign implies in itself heterogeneity as a relation” (Deleuze, 2003, p. 21), so every sign implies an opening of worlds that affects us in such a way as to push our faculties beyond their usual limits. Thus, the sign is directly affective, and thinking originates from affection. This is particularly important to us as it provides the necessary openness to conceive the production of knowledge as an intensive and bodily experience, far from a recognitive attitude.\nWhat we advocate here is that thinking does not start from something pre-established but from production through sensitivities. Our challenge, therefore, was to enable intensive encounters through signs that affirmed the production and propagation of knowledge as a sensitive and engaged experience. More than that, we know that the sign, as an affect, is effective in constructing other worlds incompatible with the established (Nascimento, 2012), so the centrality of our initiative was linked to creating disturbance spaces that, by force of the encounter, tensioned the place of madness in the social body and infected others with the idea of care in freedom.\nThus, we proposed an event that constitutes a technical production aimed at constructing an anti-asylum psychology. This initiative is especially necessary during setbacks in Brazil’s national mental health policy, resulting from the approval of a series of political projects contrary to the ideals of a society free from asylums, whether mental or structural. Given this scenario, we argue that it is more necessary than ever to provoke thought about madness and mental health care, preparing the ground for creating other ways of relating to difference.\nWe also remember that the persistence of an asylum logic within the substitute services is one of the major challenges faced by the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS), often originating in the formative processes of health professionals who fail to deconstruct the relations of domination and chronification of users typical of asylum models. To resist this, we created an innovative product, resulting from our interventions and studies on mental health care, which places the affection and contagion of reality as premises for producing and disseminating knowledge in times of tension and dispute in this field. Below, we will share some of the construction of this event, which was, above all, an experiment in knowledge produced with the other.",

    "text": "Affecting and Moving: Inventing the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Week”\nThe Anti-Asylum Struggle Week initiative results from studies on mental health care and the continued insertion that the PASÁRGADA program has had in this field since 2019. Through university extension, the group has developed activities in two Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS) - Type II in Fortaleza-CE. These actions include therapeutic group follow-ups, activities in the services’ waiting rooms, and actions beyond these facilities’ walls.\nSuch interventions rely on art as a device that enables fluidity of expression in its various forms and expands communicative notions by transcending language through senses that pulse beyond speech. Deleuze and Guattari (2010) affirm that “art wants to create a finite that restores the infinite: it traces a composition plan that carries, in turn, monuments or composed sensations, under the action of aesthetic figures” (p. 253). In this sense, the inventiveness characteristic of this device allows access to a given content that transcends the artist, the work, and the subject who visualizes it, dimensioning a vibrant reality proposing new ways of accessing life aesthetically and sensitively.\nWith this perspective, we understand that art is not limited to a humanizing tool for care, as it is also a resource that offers, through experimentation, new subjective anchors for people in psychological distress, giving them the possibility to reinvent themselves and the world. As Costa, Zanella, and Fonseca (2016) point out, art influences the composition of overflows of the established limits imposed on research, intervention, and existence. Thus, it arises for us as a form of resistance to the hegemonic ways of living imposed on madness, affirming a process of expanding the fields it can inhabit, whether concrete – in this case, social – or subjective. Therefore, our alliance with art is also made from an ethical and political struggle perspective, linked to overcoming psychiatric and asylum institutions, which have gained strength in recent years.\nDue to the social isolation situation triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, care provided in CAPS was mainly limited to psychiatric and psychological care and medication distribution, given the impossibility of conducting collective activities such as therapeutic and operative groups in person. Consequently, a scenario favorable to advancing outpatient and medicalizing care logic was cultivated in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network before the pandemic crisis (Guimarães & Sampaio, 2016), but which severely worsened during this context, implying a significant setback for psychiatric reform and the anti-asylum project, already greatly weakened by the advance of neoliberalism and conservatism in the country.\nThe vision of constructing the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event arose from the loosening of sanitary measures and the return of in-person activities in early 2022. It also emerges from the memory that constitutes PASÁRGADA, which, in its years of existence, has conducted various actions stitching together health services, universities, social movements, and society. Crossed by what Deleuze (1992) asserts when he says “a little bit of possible, otherwise I suffocate…” (p. 131), we are called to re-enchant May 18 in a context of psychological, social, and political fragility, as well as setbacks in psychiatric reform and uncertainty regarding the reality we once knew and are called to inhabit again after the COVID-19 calamity.\nIt is worth noting that the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day reflects a series of disputes and the active participation of the community, workers, families, and people in psychological distress. Espírito Santo, Araújo, and Amarante (2016) state that, from the emergence of the Mental Health Workers Movement (MTSM) in the 1970s, denunciations against the treatment model then used as a reference in the mental health field reverberated. The strictly biomedical perspective, along with reports of violence against the bodies inhabiting so-called care spaces, described an unsustainable situation, resulting in the 8th National Health Conference and, a year later, the First National Mental Health Conference. The emergency and change scenario produced during the second MTSM congress in 1987 established May 18 as a symbolic date for maintaining and engaging in a rights struggle, care in freedom, and de-asyluming life.\nAmarante and Nunes (2018) highlight that during the occasion, the slogan “For a society without asylums” was created, and the social movement became more complex, gaining participation from new social actors (users, families, and other human rights activists). Additionally, a new horizon of demand was built, focused on deconstructing the asylum logic and its institutional apparatus, thus constituting itself as the “Anti-Asylum Struggle Movement (MLA).” According to the authors:\n\nA decisive element for this expansion [of the MLA] was the creation of the National Anti-Asylum Struggle Day in Bauru. May 18 would serve to awaken critical thinking in society about the institutional violence of psychiatry and the exclusion of people in psychological distress. It can be considered that the objective was successful to the extent that, since then, political, scientific, cultural, and social activities have been carried out not only on the day in question but throughout the month of May, which came to be considered the Anti-Asylum Struggle Month. Given the significant repercussion of the events organized by the MLA and their substantial participation in broader health issues, the term “mentalistas” (in reference to heavy metal) became widely used to characterize the “noise” caused by this social actor (Amarante & Nunes, 2018, p. 2070).\n\nThus, given the importance of this date, guided by the construction of comprehensive care, in freedom and integration (in the network), we questioned how to create crossings that could disrupt what is rigid in psychosocial care and continue the proposal of care that transcends the service structure. The challenges arise from the intersection of a moment of collective mourning, physical reinsertion into previously uninhabited spaces, and significant sensitization regarding mental health and social ties. Therefore, we are called to challenge the established and bet on inventiveness and affection as mobilizing forces, creating the 2022 Anti-Asylum Struggle Week event.\nThis event featured diverse activities distributed over five days, namely:\n\nMonday: a procession through Benfica and a discussion circle at the university.\nTuesday: an action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV and a panel discussion at the university.\nWednesday: participation in the public act promoted by the Ceará Anti-Asylum Struggle Forum (FCLA) in the city center.\nThursday: organization of an exhibition; and\nFriday: in-person display of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” exhibition at São José Theater.\n\nThe construction and implementation of this venture were only possible thanks to the alliances built with partner institutions and professionals, users, social movements, university sectors, and a range of agencies that, according to Deleuze and Guattari (2003), “… extend or penetrate an unlimited field of immanence that melts segments, freeing desire from all its concretions and abstractions, or at least actively struggles against them to dissolve them” (p. 145). Thus, we sought to create crossings that brought movement to the crystallized practices in the mental health field.\nThe event began on May 16, Monday, with a procession through the streets of Benfica, a neighborhood with a high flow of people and the location of the UFC Psychology Department. The act was carried out alongside the carnival block “Doido é Tu!”. This moment aimed to compose a struggle that arises from alliances and through boundary transgression, proposing a contagion with the city, the university, art, and culture, weaving the struggle for ethical-political care. As Martins (2009) points out, “in anti-asylum practices, the city, madness, and art meet and together make an appeal for life. They demand less life to be lived and more pulsating life…” (p. 86).\nThe procession emitted notes that vibrated through the city, prompting passing cars to honk and pedestrians to shout with us, through a porosity that permeated boundaries. We took flight, sang, walked, danced, shouted, and landed. The act ended at the Moreira Campos Forest, located in the Center for Humanities I at UFC, where we gathered and settled for a discussion circle titled “Anti-Asylum Struggles: Still!”. This location was purposely chosen, as it has a high flow of people moving daily, potentially engaging with the proposed discussion.\nWe aimed to enter the university by shattering crystallizations regarding madness and seeking to broaden this debate not only within a course focused on mental health, such as Psychology, but for society as a whole. In agreement with the Basaglian perspective, we proposed to discuss the possibility of inventing new strategies for restructuring cultural organization regarding the presence of the subject in distress and the disturbance they determine, producing other modes of expressing this experience of suffering (Basaglia, 2010).\nSettling visibly to passersby, singing, dancing, dialoguing, and inquiring: can madness occupy the university? In this composition between passing flows, the large circle included users and service professionals, professors, and students from various university courses. It was realized through the collective space of sharing and discussing the history of the Anti-Asylum Struggle and Brazilian Psychiatric Reform, its processes and setbacks, and the need to maintain it today.\nAt this moment, the struggle was tensioned as pluralized, as it is also an anti-racist, anti-LGBTQUIAP+phobic, and anti-fascist struggle, configuring itself as a demand for care that promotes quality of life for the bodies occupying this space. Basaglia (1985), analyzing the condition of the institutionalized, places the subject in psychological distress as a subject without rights, subjected to institutional powers, socially excluded due to their social and economic condition rather than the illness itself. Stela do Patrocínio (2009), a Black poet interned for almost 30 years, tells us that “being interned is being imprisoned all day” (p. 47), thus the asylum being a strategy for controlling and imprisoning bodies, mainly Black and poor. Therefore, it is crucial to think of mental health care that is provided in freedom and intersectionalized, recognizing the identity markers placed in the field of subordination, producing illnesses and new forms of the asylum.\nOn the second day of the event, we organized a morning action in the waiting room at CAPS II - CORES IV. This activity is a standard practice of Pasárgada since its insertion in health facilities, during waiting times for appointments or medication, for example. We propose interactive activities, provocative installations, and interventions that move the bodies present, aiming to subvert the outpatient logic marking this waiting time. Furthermore, aligning with Deleuze’s (1999, 27 de junho) association between art and resistance, we aim to construct other possibilities for life production through the contact between the device and mental health.\nUnderstanding the possibility of constructing possible paths of life, other creations for existence, the activity had the key question “What do we do to be free?”, with pens, colored pencils, markers, glue, colorful glue, and images, as well as a poster on an easel for producing a collective work from this trigger. The objective was to think about what freedom meant to each person, what affected them in this sense, and how it could be understood expansively and collectively, understanding the processes of subjectivation and the ways existence weaves itself beyond the neoliberal and individualistic ideal. The action was planned as care involved in not individualizing users, proposing, instead, a process of constructing collective resistances against systematic oppressions that attempt to suffocate difference, through forming alliances as a possible bet in the care in freedom experimentation process.\nAdditionally, in the afternoon, a panel discussion was held at the Center for Humanities II at UFC, proposed by VIESES (Research and Interventions on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation Group), in partnership with FCLA, with support from PASÁRGADA, titled “Mental Health Care in Ceará: Concerns and Propositions.” The panel discussion focused on the mental health of children and adolescents and their current challenges; necropolitics and its impacts on mental health; and political disputes surrounding care for alcohol and other drug users. We understood this space as an opportunity to provoke critical academic thought about the reality of mental health in Ceará today, articulating different social actors from various contexts.\nThe setbacks in mental health policies highlighted by Passarinho (2022) when discussing government funding of therapeutic communities and psychiatric hospitals in the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS) emerged in this moment through the voices of workers and users. Moreover, the poor management of worker care, alongside the scarcity of public contests in this field – strategies for strengthening the bond between professionals and users through the permanence in the service – was highlighted as a central tool for proposing ethical care.\nThe disregard for children and adolescents’ mental health due to lack of incentive and the policy of youth mortification marked by race, gender, and socioeconomic status was another emphasized topic. The logic of making live and letting die that promotes life only for bodies considered normal was evident at this moment through the reports brought by those involved in this network, corroborating Mbembe’s (2018) notion that, “in the economy of biopower, the function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and make possible the murderous functions of the State” (p. 18).\nFurthermore, it was stated that the lack of incentive for harm reduction policy in favor of prohibitionist logics perpetuating the dynamics in the field of assistance to alcohol and other drug users chronifies the problem and reproduces asylum and violence practices. Harm reduction promotes a joint construction for experiences with psychoactive substances involving participation in policy management in the field and the reduction or even cessation of drug use (E. H. Passos & Souza, 2011). The panel discussion discussing these three axes raised many concerns and brought propositions around what was discussed, aiming to take the highlighted points to conferences and forums, contributing to public policy planning.\nOn the third day of action promotion, May 18, 2022, we made an ethical-political commitment to be in the street, participating in the act organized and led by FCLA and mobilizing the academic community to join this activity. The concentration for the political demonstration for care in freedom took place at Praça do Ferreira, in the city center, to create new visibility zones for madness, as Silva (2006) points out, the place is historically marked by\n\n… significant social content, constituting itself, over the years, as an “icon” for Fortaleza. A traditional meeting and sociability place, it was an excellent leisure space, still today the square of greatest representation in the center. The great vitality that takes place there becomes noticeable through cultural events, social manifestations, and the persistence of some uses that have been resisting the transformations in that public space. (p. 106)\n\nAmarante (2007) states that there is a sociocultural dimension in the Brazilian psychiatric reform process that is strategic in attempting to provoke the social imaginary through questioning about madness, mental illness, and psychiatric hospitals, based on the cultural and artistic production of social actors composing this movement. In this sense, historically, as mentioned above, May 18 and the following days mark social, cultural, and political movements with the participation of users, professionals, and families to claim and guarantee rights, care policies, and occupy the city for the anti-asylum struggle.\nThus, being on the street, occupying the city with art, music, dance, and slogans, is necessary. Inhabiting this territory as a meeting point, with bodies denied access to public space, is a process of affirming difference. Being there, professionals, users, families, students, politicians, and militants, is a bet on destabilizing what is set in macro-politics and the asylum structure, announcing our presence as a demand for the right to the city. Additionally, persisting as a group gathering on this date, amid a challenging political scenario – especially concerning public health – constitutes a collective construction of care and an ethical-political commitment to the anti-asylum agenda that must be strengthened. We also emphasize that participating in this act highlights the perspective of knowledge not only produced within university walls theoretically but also constructed through experimentation with the social actors involved and their life contexts.\nAgain, the carnival block “Doido é tu!” was present, enhancing this moment with music and dances. We produced posters, raised flags, and walked together to the headquarters of the Fortaleza Municipal Health Secretariat, where a letter written by FCLA listing and demanding points for effective care in Fortaleza’s psychosocial care network was delivered.\nOn May 19, we focused on organizing and assembling our final action for that Week, which was characterized by the in-person exhibition of the “Desambula: so that desire can flow” project. Thus, on May 20, we had this exhibition in partnership with CAPS II - CORES IV in Fortaleza. The idea for this action emerged from the desire to echo this artistic presentation, which initially took place virtually, with production starting in 2021, when the idea was proposed to one of the art therapy groups to create and organize works for an exhibition, culminating in 2022. The objective was to think and create an exhibition together with the artist and the group users, constructing a collective exhibition from the activities proposed in the group, resulting in the arts, the theme of the exhibition, the website, and the curatorial process.\nDespite the difficulties of constructing a care process through hybrid contact amid a pandemic, the virtual exhibition opened on February 16, 2022, with the website’s launch alongside the artists in a discussion circle via Google Meet, and closed on March 16, 2022. Thus, primarily proposing a relationship transforming Western society’s relationship with madness (Amarante, 1994), we brought the exhibition to the in-person format at São José Theater in Fortaleza, concluding the Anti-Asylum Struggle Week.\nSão José Theater, the chosen exhibition site, was created in 1914 and is a historic facility in Fortaleza, located in the city center, representing a significant cultural hub. Recently renovated after years of closure, it now features an important cultural program for the city. Thus, the choice of the theater stemmed from our previously stated desire to occupy the urban space in highly trafficked locations.\nThe works composing the in-person exhibition were the same as those in the virtual exhibition but with a different configuration, featuring interactive frames made by the artist-users with materials like bottle caps, sequins, threads, glitter, and even seeds. Additionally, all works were suspended with colorful strings, proposing movement with bodies beyond manual touch with the materialities. The room was arranged so visitors could follow a path starting with reception and information about the exhibition’s construction and leading to an installation with two projectors: one displaying audiovisual works and the other showing strictly visual works, all produced in the group space.\nThere were also some artistic installations proposing reflections on themes intersecting the mental health field. A mirror installation with the famous phrase “up close, nobody is normal,” from Caetano Veloso’s song “Vaca Profana,” invited people to interact and photograph themselves. Another installation, “How to Become Uncompressed? II,” by Caio Prado, in a corner, invited people to interact by discarding empty medication blister packs, prompting reflections on the medicalization of life. Finally, we organized a collective creation space where visitors could overflow the affections of this encounter. We placed poster boards on an easel before the room exit, providing paint, colored pens, threads, and glue for composing a materiality consisting of writings, drawings, and interventions by passersby after the visit.\nThroughout the day, over 100 people visited the exhibition, including the artists and their families, users from other CAPS in Fortaleza, such as those from CAPS AD in Regional IV, health professionals, public university students, private college students, high school institutions, technical courses, and many curious individuals. The purpose was to give visibility to the artists and their works, as there was a desire in the group to exhibit, and many had never had the opportunity, while also considering how art holds an essential place of possibility when it comes to mental health care and the de-stigmatization of these individuals, positioning the city as a point of involvement.\nCities, beyond buildings, houses, and intertwined streets producing materiality, are also stages for affections and social relations (Mansano, 2016). By understanding the city as this place of intertwining, we also understand that it is where life, encounters, and discussions are produced. Madness, long imprisoned – from the 17th century, as Foucault (1975) mentions, saying that madness entered this world of exclusion by an ideal of incapacity and reconstruction of the social space of the time – must also be intertwined in this city. Going out into the world implies, therefore, a form of resistance to these historical policies of exclusion, violence, and stigmatization of these bodies.",

    "text": "Final Considerations\nPassos et al. (2021) point out that the country is advancing towards a process of (re)asylumization driven by the interest of actors representing a conservative and neoliberal political project centered on maintaining privileges and focused on privatizations and the revival of social control practices. Therefore, we observe the importance of events like the one proposed for producing materiality seen, touched, and felt, as well as for producing sensitization, reflection, and debates on the anti-asylum agenda, acting on the de-stigmatization of madness and proposing care produced in freedom.\nA Psychology that aims to be Anti-Asylum must seek, within the University, to produce knowledge articulated with the proposition of new ethical and political horizons, seeking to combat this scenario of oppression and stigma. It must, therefore, commit to fostering solutions beyond academic walls, enabling exchanges with subjects and groups often marginalized from these discussions but affected by them and creating resistances in their daily lives.\nIn this sense, we emphasize that promoting an event like this, aimed at creating displacements in the very form of producing knowledge and academic practices, was only possible from a perspective of collective work and with the different social actors forming this context. Mutual contagion of experiences, thoughts, and creations. A technical production, but also alive, launching us into new problems and concerns for our studies, research, and practices. At the interface between the University and society, we affirm an affective engagement centered on breaking rigid models of knowledge production, forming ourselves also as body-researcher-experimenters of an anti-asylum mental health and new ways of learning, caring, and living.",

    "section": "Final Considerations",
    "text": "Final Considerations\nThe Polyphonies Extension Project, through transdisciplinary and dialogical practices, seeks to disseminate scientific knowledge beyond the university, thus breaking down walls and the hierarchy of knowledge. Its activities are guided by transdisciplinarity, gaining even more strength through dialogue, which aids in the development and conduct of events, making them accessible to the general public and constructing the project collaboratively. The project’s actions focus on knowledge dissemination, understanding it as a process collectively gestated from the encounter of different subjects who have the opportunity to hear and be heard. In this sense, it can be said that Polyphonies’ ultimate goal is to contribute to social transformation by fostering and encouraging the invention of complex, rooted, and relevant knowledge addressing the issues affecting the various actors and contexts shaping societies.\nThus, the events organized by the project reflect its interest in dialogue and contact with the other, marked in their names. “Polyphonies,” “Bar Talks,” and “Clubefonia” remove the rigidity with which scientific information is typically approached, giving rise to relaxed and potent conversations, precisely because they are more than “information transfer” venues. The audience is not seen as passive; on the contrary, their thoughts, cultures, and knowledge are incorporated into the dialogue to broaden the contact and understanding of reality. Therefore, it is valid to say that Polyphonies works with the plurality of voices, ideas, people, cultures, and knowledge. Driven by the possibility of viewing the world through a transdisciplinary lens, the project seeks to learn, express, and foster this vision through its actions.\nHowever, there are challenges and room for improvement. Among the challenges, the Polyphonies team is dedicated to finding strategies to “break the bubble,” that is, to increasingly mobilize the participation of people outside the university who have access to the project and its events. In this endeavor, the group is organizing to promote the project itself through various social media (Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.), emphasizing its interest in an audience with diverse educational levels, backgrounds, and social roles.\nAnother challenge is imposed by the limitations of the virtual event environment. While it enables breaking physical barriers by bringing together individuals from different cities, it also restricts the intensity of possible interactions, particularly affecting the dialogue with the participating audience, which tends to be more passive in this scenario.\nAware of these and other difficulties, Polyphonies remains committed to its goal of enabling knowledge exchange and re-establishing the long-lost connection between science and society through its actions, bringing the community to a new place: that of a knowledge builder, thus contributing to scientific dissemination.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "LAEDDES & ENEDDES: Extension in Motion (A Brief Historical Overview)\nThe Interdisciplinary Meeting of Studies on Inequalities & Diversities - ENEDDES, previously named ENEDES in its first two editions in 2013 and 2016, emerged from the studies and research conducted by the extensionists of the university extension program “Knowledge is Active Citizenship - LAEDES - Laboratory of Studies on Inequalities” (from March 2010 to August 2018), part of the Psychology course at the Federal University of Ceará, Sobral Campus.\nThe extension program, initiated in 2010, stimulates debate and articulation of studies on poverty, inequality, and exclusion, drawing from Sociology, Critical Social Psychology, Psychology, Education, among others. The project targeted public school students, most of whom experienced the implications of poverty and its complications.\nThe extension group conducted activities to demystify the discourse of meritocracy and the fatalism that the impoverished face daily. Using the methodology of conversation circles, dialogues with students aimed to promote arguments against blaming poor people, presenting education as a path to autonomy, citizenship, and political participation. Embedded in a public university in the interior, part of the federal university expansion program, and attentive to the context of social marginalization, suffering, and expiation of the poor population, LAEDDES has always positioned itself against the false meritocracy discourse. With the advancement of discussions and student movements, in 2018, the program’s title was changed to: LAEDDES – Laboratory of Studies on Inequalities & Diversities.\nThis name change reflects the theoretical, methodological, ethical, and political transformations of the undergraduates in academic and social debates and their interaction with the community. Consequently, in 2020, a connection with the Professional Master’s in Psychology and Public Policies at the UFC Sobral campus was established.\nAiming to amplify discussions on these topics and to disseminate the debates developed in the extension program to the academic community and the general public, the Laboratory took on the challenge and commitment to organize ENEDES, viewing it as an event capable of mobilizing new tensions, creating interaction spaces between undergraduates and scholars, raising theoretical and practical reflections that could reverberate in social transformations and contribute to and innovate in public policy creation.\nThe Interdisciplinary Meeting of Studies on Inequalities – ENEDES, occurred in two editions, in 2013 and 2016, attracting over 500 people, including students and professionals from various fields such as Psychology, Social Sciences, Social Work, as well as professionals working in education and public policies in Sobral and neighboring municipalities. The event successfully promoted debates on Education, Inequalities, and Democracy.\nDuring this period, the event’s name was altered to ENEDDES - National Meeting of Studies on Inequalities and Diversities. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the third in-person event was not held. However, considering the immense impacts of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations, the Pré-Eneddes was organized virtually in November 2020 to create dialogues on the pandemic’s context, the deterioration of public policies, and their effects on education, health, social assistance, and democracy, as a way to address pain and anguish and to advocate for collective well-being.",

Popular knowledge is fundamental for us to deal with the pains and worldviews, while scientific knowledge serves as lenses that alert us to which direction we should look. He argued that education is still the gateway to emancipation and the exit from precarious conditions of economic, political, and cultural misery. In summary, these were the rich discussions and debates that permeated the three-day event.\n\n\n2nd ENEDES\nThe second meeting, titled II ENEDES and I International Symposium on Poverty and Social Transformation, was held in person on December 14 and 15, 2016. Its main objective was to discuss topics transversal to LAEDES themes, such as:\n\nCitizenship;\nDemocracy and Human Rights;\nPoverty and Coping Strategies;\nPoverty, Media, and Social Representations;\nYouth and Vulnerabilities;\nPublic Health;\nGender and Social Determinants;\nMusic and Social Transformation.\n\nAt this event, we had the presence of Ana Fonseca, a researcher and promoter of the Bolsa Família Program in Brazil, who fought against social inequalities through public policies until her death. The event also featured Canadian researchers Susan O’Neill and Yaroslav Senyshyn, who presented music as a means of emancipation from poverty. The II ENEDES concluded with a conference on Social Representations of Poverty by Aline Accorssi, enriched by different representatives speaking from various fields of knowledge.\n\n\nPré-ENEDDES\nIn times of backlash against social policies and dismantling of fundamental achievements for improving the living conditions of low-income populations affected by ethical-political suffering, organizing the Pré-ENEDDES edition was considered a form of resistance. It also provided access to knowledge from various fields for our target audience, including UFC students and public school teachers. We hope that the debates promoted by the event, related to reflections on the intersections between poverty and education, as well as discussions on gender, race, and class relations within public schools, contribute to the training of LAEDDES extension students, public school teachers, and other members of the academic community. The Pré-ENEDDES was organized by undergraduate students and master’s students in Psychology and Public Policies.",

    "text": "Debate and Mobilization Axes: Social Inequalities, Youth, and Education\n\nSocial Inequalities – Poverty: Outlines and Definitions\nStudying and thinking about poverty is a delicate subject with a difficult definition. Within our theoretical field of human sciences, our question is more qualitative and variable, under construction. As Accorssi and Scarparo (2016) have warned, “poverty is a polysemic and complex concept that requires care” (p. 68). The definitions of public policies to combat poverty and the economic perspectives of the World Bank and MDS, GDP, HDI, have their importance in directing policies aimed at people in vulnerable social contexts and in strategies to combat this situation. However, these are not the only ways to understand the concept of poverty.\nPoverty is not just food insecurity, precarious housing, or lack of education; it is also political. As Pedro Demo (2006) explains, poverty “is not pure and simple misery, but the one imposed, the discriminatory one, or, above all, the one of the majority due to the enrichment of the minority” (p. 7).\nPoverty can also be thought of as unequal access to modes of production. For Estanislau and Ximenes (2016), poverty is a “process, a consequence of the capitalist mode of production, whose important characteristics are the exploitation of labor to produce wealth and the concentration of income. A significant contingent of individuals is precariously inserted into the production process” (p. 142).\nContinuing on unequal access, Jessé Souza (2003) identifies poverty as the constitution and reproduction in differentiated modes of people’s skills who, without access or with greater limitations to educational and professional qualification, cannot enter or remain in the qualified labor market for a prolonged period.\nThe term impoverished is the classification chosen by Guareschi (1992) to talk about poverty. For him, in a world of categories, it is possible to talk about poor and rich, but in the world of relationships, no, as it requires one and the other. In this case, there are enriched and impoverished individuals, a dialectical relationship, people who have been impoverished.\nThere is a multiplicity of classifications, ways to measure and identify poverty. This indicates that the issue of income does not sufficiently explain how this phenomenon is experienced and defined by people. Various authors describe poverty in a broad way, alerting to the need for a plural vision of the phenomenon and dimensions of participation, dignity, and social recognition. Poverty is not a natural condition and, although historical, dialectical, it therefore requires combat (Guzzo, 2016).\n\n\nBrazil, a Country of Poverty: Socioeconomic and Psychosocial Implications\nIn Brazil, even with the old commitments to eradicate poverty in international agreements and the exit from the hunger map in 2012, the country has regressed and suffers from the estimated numbers of 61 million people in poverty, 19.3 million of whom are in extreme poverty, according to the research by the Center for Research in Macroeconomics of Inequalities at the University of São Paulo (Nassif-Pires et al., 2021). Thus, poverty remains latent, absurd, and immoral at all levels.\nThis scenario is most often explained from an economicist perspective, of a neoliberal nature, but it needs to be expanded. After all, it is not just about material absences; poverty “can entail specific and oppressive forms of identity constitution, weakening individuals’ potentialities, maintaining existing conditions of oppression in society, and reproducing discriminatory practices towards poor individuals” (Moura Junior, 2012, p. 15).\nThat said, it is important to remember the ruptures of bonds, the precariousness that poverty represents most of the time. In Brazil, in this social, cultural, and political segregation, poverty and exclusion align. Thus, the naturalization of poverty and the stigmas of this category gain painful dimensions (Wanderley, 1999).\nIn this class of disposables, there is no process of citizenship, but rather one of subcitizenship, a collective practice of unjust social recognition. In it, the notion of subcitizenship implies a hierarchical valuation of people, implicitly and institutionally rooted in an invisible way, which determines who is or is not considered human and, consequently, who is or is not a citizen. This process fundamentally impacts the differentiated access to material and symbolic resources in social life (Souza, 2003).\nVarious constraints cross this group not only by material lacks, an unquestionable fact, but also by subjective ones, that is, in the social imagination of these people. As part of this, processes such as shame and humiliation were well depicted in the studies of Moura Jr. (2012), Ximenes et al. (2016), and Jovchelevitch (2013). The field of imagination, of planning, is strongly affected when experiencing a family/educational context marked by poverty, which “can permeate different levels and spaces: from hunger to existential (subjective) conditions, and from these conditions to ruptures in sociability relations” (Accorssi & Scarparo, 2016, p. 91).\nIn this sense, studying poverty and its implications on the subjectivities of the poor population crosses the creation and constitution of events and debates. Inviting, dialoguing, and listening to scholars on the subject was a way to stimulate in other spaces and audiences the need for greater closeness to the theme, favor the continuity of studies/research, present gaps, and reflect on other (re)actions and places of action.\n\n\nSocial Inequalities: The Interfaces of Subcitizenship in Peripheral Societies\nThe work of sociologist Jessé de Souza brought a vast collection of theories related to Brazil’s exclusive modernization process and the production of subcitizens. His concept of subcitizen reveals the naturalization of oppression and humiliation experienced by most of the population and is recognized by an illusory concept of equality in the current competitive order.\nThe individual who is already born deprived of basic conditions such as health, food, education, or has limited access to them, has a high chance of not meeting the competitive market’s demands, which probably will not give them social recognition and “utility” in this economic model (which incorporates the social), potentially leaving them at the mercy of dramatic political and personal consequences.\nSubcitizenship is not only related to the historical marginalization of various social groups but also to the reproduction and maintenance of most individuals outside the objective order of modern production, which requires specific personalities and behaviors. Becoming a complete and productive citizen is intimately related to the concept of the rational subject’s dignity. As this mode of production acquired almost dogmatic characteristics over the years, failure is seen as a personal misfortune, causing millions to remain on the margins of society (Souza, 2003).\nUnderstanding subcitizenship and how it is structured also involves reinterpreting Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of habitus by sociologist Jessé Souza, who states:\n\nIf habitus represents the incorporation in subjects of evaluative schemes and behavioral dispositions from a structural socioeconomic situation, then fundamental changes in the economic-social structure must consequently imply significant qualitative changes in the type of habitus for all social classes involved in some way in these changes (Souza, 2003, p. 165)\n\nSouza (2003) analyzed the concept of habitus in three spheres to explain other configurations of reality. The primary habitus, he defines, originates from Bourdieu’s studies on the transition of traditional societies to modern society in the West. This habitus would have originated in the bourgeoisie, the first ruling class in capitalist society.\nFor Bourdieu, the “secondary habitus” lies in the dimension of “taste.” It would be at the upper limit of the “precarious habitus,” where the “primary habitus” extends to a wide range of people in a given society. It is related to the source of social recognition and respect, in which patterns of social classification and distinction play a prominent role (Souza, 2003).\nThe focus of this theory’s deepening lies in the concept coined by Souza (2003) of “precarious habitus.” The concept of habitus in marginal societies, late capitalism, can be extended to its most precarious level, where it would be a place marked by the lack of a set of psychosocial tendencies reflected in the role of the producer, in the field of personality, with direct reflections on the role of the citizen.\nIndividuals of this habitus have not incorporated these requirements into their daily lives to constitute themselves as “full and complete citizens.” They lack a sufficient position in the labor market, especially if we attribute to work the basic values that constitute this “meritocratic triad.” From their qualification, position, and salary, this individual and their group will be recognized in their society (Souza, 2003).\nIt is possible, therefore, to perceive that there is a power relationship, those who can and those who cannot, the visible and the invisible, the legitimate and the illegitimate, and, therefore, there is, on the part of the social, a domination of positions and spaces established for this other, besides being seen as the culprit for social failures. This relationship became possible when modernity architected a binary logic, which denominated in different ways the negative component of the cultural relationship: marginal, indigent, mad, disabled, drug addict, homosexual, foreigner, etc (Duschatzky & Skliar, 2001).",

    "text": "Debate Axis: Youth and Education: The Relationship of Poor Youth with School\nWhen discussing poverty, social inequality, and gender themes, ENEDDES directs these discussions to the young public, understanding that they are directly affected by these phenomena and all their implications. Therefore, it is important to understand what youth the event addressed and the relationship of poor youth with education.\nAccording to Léon (2005), in the country, various fields of study and authors have dedicated themselves to discussing youth, thus constructing various views on this category, structured from different social and political perspectives, which end up fostering and guiding actions aimed at this public. These perspectives often generate dichotomous views on youth.\nThe multiple images about youth are socially constructed models, which often bring simplistic views that prevent us from “understanding the ways in which young people, especially those from popular classes, construct their experiences” (Dayrell, 2003, p. 41), making these experiences often neglected.\nYouth cannot be taken as a unique, singular, chronological, and homogeneous phenomenon, analyzed, and understood from a rigid axis. As Cordeiro (2009) affirms, being young goes beyond a generational phase, as it is related to multiple life experiences, linked to young people’s belonging to the different social spaces they occupy, whether it is school, work, or the community. It is about transiting through these experiences, being crossed and constituted by them.\nIn this sense, ENEDDES worked with the notion of plural, heterogeneous youth and considered the multiple ways and experiences of being young, understanding young people as social subjects who appropriate and interpret the contexts they are inserted in, giving them meaning, just as they give meaning to the places they occupy. Thus, young people are subjects who are biologically, socially, and culturally constituted in relationships with others (Dayrell, 2003).\nTaking these young people as social subjects means considering that each one lives the condition of being young based on contexts and previous histories. Therefore, markers such as gender, race, economic conditions, social class, and inequality directly interfere with the ways of being young, as well as in their trajectories and how they signify and understand education.\nThe relationship young people establish with school is constructed from numerous markers and can acquire different meanings. Sposito and Galvão (2004) point out that the meanings young people attribute to education arise from the subjectivation and experiences of each individual. Given this, it is necessary to consider that education in the lives of poor youth assumes different roles; for many, it is seen as a stage or a duty to be fulfilled, for others, a tool for transforming the realities they live.\nEducation in Brazil is pointed out in both studies and public policy actions as one of the main tools to combat inequalities, essential for overcoming social problems and for social mobility. However, this relationship between inequality and education yields permanent dialogues, as sometimes education is believed to overcome social inequalities, and at other times, it is seen as an eternal source of reproducing inequalities (Yannoulas, 2013).\nBourdieu and Passeron (2014) describe the school as a space for reproducing social inequalities, which are felt in the unequal distribution of educational opportunities according to origin and social class, in the access of poor youth to education systems, and in how this access occurs.\nSouza (2009) highlighted that, in a space marked by social inequality, the dissemination of advanced knowledge is still limited to children and youth from the dominant classes. Meanwhile, children from poor families receive limited education in the school to the basic knowledge type required for their future professional lives. He also highlights the myth of individual merit (meritocracy), which would depend on isolating the individual from society, as if everything they achieve in their life did not depend on the possibilities that society offers them.\nAnalyzing the relationship between poverty and the student population, Duarte (Duarte, 2012) points out that 44% of the student population in public elementary education in Brazil was in poverty in 2009. In the Northeast region, 67% of students were in social vulnerability conditions.\nStill according to the same author, analyzing the indices between youth and schooling, the disparities are significant. While 76% of students among the wealthiest 25% had completed high school by the age of 19, among the poorest 25%, this rate drops to 16%. For youth between 15 and 17 years old attending high school, the rate is 81% among the wealthiest and 30% among the poorest. These indices indicate that poor students are not a minority in public schools; they are a majority that needs to be considered (Duarte, 2012).\nConsidering the interfaces of subcitizenship in education, the issue is often marked by many educators’ view of the impoverished student, as Souza (2009) points out:\n\n… Analyzing public education policy texts from the State of São Paulo, he found the presence of demeaning conceptions about popular classes, accompanied by the idea that the school needs to assume the family’s role. This perspective ends up transforming the school institution mainly into a space for socialization, having its capacity to fulfill its social function impaired (p. 51).\n\nConsidering public education policy, we recognize this field as a strong marker of individual differences, as it has long been constituted on the sphere of difference and categorization of individuals, including the various manifestations of poverty and social inequality. Thus, the school must continuously evaluate its practices, think and experiment with new educational practices to better establish relationships with the social reality in which it is inserted. It is noted that it is not about destroying or extinguishing established parameters but generating a denaturalization of traditional teaching measures to constitute educational practices that genuinely promote education and, consequently, citizenship.\nIt is fundamentally important to realize that the school context is strongly linked to the constitution of social and subjective representation. The plurality of structuring forms creates a dialectic between standardization or permissiveness. The school will serve as a mediator, or rather, an environment that will propose mediations between individuals who will be constituted from the interaction with others and the positions they will occupy in the social context in which they are inserted.\nConsidering education as a promoter of citizenship, it should include social diversity and recognize these individuals as subjects of rights, who come from different cultural realities and experiences, building their frame of reference for thought and action from this. It is up to the teacher to broaden their view beyond the school’s walls, to know the student’s starting territory, their values, what is significant in their life.\nIn this sense, school education is one of the main and fundamental spaces for systematically disseminating principles related to differences, diversities, and inequalities, requiring the performance of committed and well-informed teachers. However, the teachers’ own training in related topics is still very limited, hindering quality work with students at various educational levels, as good intentions alone are not enough for the educator to deal with the issues of difference, diversity, and inequality. It takes much more than that; it requires theoretical grounding and knowledge on the topics.\nBesides serving as a mechanism, the place for difference should not be forced but managed. The school should not position itself as an institution of fixed concepts and ways of dealing with individuals but should perceive itself as an institution dealing with subjects who present themselves in various possible performances.\nThus, education can be a valuable tool for helping liberate historically impoverished groups, consolidating the generation of rights; or it can configure the opposite, becoming another instrument of humiliation, social rejection, and disdain by public agents towards the poor, reinforcing stereotypes and prejudices (Brandão et al., 2013).",

    "text": "Transgressional Axes: Diversities\nIn addition to the initial thematic axes, the event’s discussions included themes such as gender, the LGBTQIA+ movement, race/ethnicity, peripheral youth, and marginal lives and knowledge. Space for other epistemologies is necessary to ensure the foundation of studies and actions. Thus, decolonial studies, black feminism, feminist and gender studies also incorporate the foundations of research and analyses of the extension program’s works and future events.\n\nIntersectionality\nArising from the extension’s concerns and experiences, ENEDDES focused on organizing an event to debate themes and works from the concept of intersectionality. According to Akotirene (2019), intersectionality is a multiple concept, being a theory, methodology, and research tool that, by articulating race, gender, and class, critically analyzes the intersection and convergence of cisheteronormative/patriarchal/imperialist/racist structures, among others, as well as an ethic aimed at recovering silenced voices, annulled bodies, new humanities. In this sense, in Crenshaw’s (2002) analogy, thinking from intersectionality means perceiving the clash between historically oppressive structures as traffic lanes that dictate advantages and disadvantages depending on one’s “place” in the world. Thinking and articulating social issues intersectionally allows for analyzing the dynamics of the social structure and its pernicious products. It is not about overlapping oppressions, quantifying pain, but thinking and developing politically other modes of (re)knowledge.\n\n\nGender: Multiple Understandings, Still Unknown to Popular Knowledge\nGender is a term and concept of broad debate not for the purpose of producing an exact, static definition, but to promote dialogue and distance from misunderstandings about the topic. The understanding that gender and sexuality are relational and natural is still prevalent and dangerous.\nThus, regarding gender, a concept produced from feminist movements and struggles, there is no consensus and exact definition. However, according to authors such as Berenice Bento, Guacira Louro, and Judith Butler, gender, although considering physical elements of the body, is not defined by biological sex or sexuality. Gender is a social and historical construction about the biological distinctions of bodies crossed by socially elaborated sexual characteristics. It is in social relations, discourses, and languages that gender, gender performance, emerges and reproduces.\nConstituent of subjectivities, there is no determinism, biological essentialism, but a social, relational question about the category, which is analytical and political. It is also in the social arena of relational, institutional practices that gender inequalities and hierarchies occur.",

Therefore, it is impossible to think of ENEDDES without LAEDDES. For the people who designed the meetings, the classroom extends beyond the disciplines. In each text, discussion, and theme, there were struggles in this process: welcoming, learning, sharing. Guided by an education as a practice of freedom and not as an activity of domination (hooks, 2013), the event’s foundation will always be laid.\nThe daily difficulty of hoping, especially after the most progressive period of the supposed Brazilian democracy, is highlighted. The defamation of human rights, the dismantling of public policies, the freezing of public spending, the commodification of public education, the fascist governmental structure, and the COVID-19 pandemic have further exacerbated social inequalities, poverty, and silenced youth and marginal knowledge.\nDespite the limitations the event faced, we hope that by presenting the memory of ENEDDES, it can, beyond registering our existences, contribute to further studies on the topic, foster other research on the subject, and strengthen practices and public policies aimed at combating inequalities, especially in educational institutions.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThere is a difficulty in establishing the relationship between work and the illness of public servants (Ramminger & Nardi, 2007). Until 2009, the health of public servants at Universities and Federal Institutes was related to medical and dental examinations. Health promotion and prevention actions and their aggravations were practically nonexistent before the implementation of the Policy for Attention to Health and Occupational Safety of Federal Public Servants (PASS). The demands of this public, until then, were focused on improvements in remuneration and training. After the structuring and consolidation of the career plan for technical-administrative positions in education, from Law No. 11,091, of January 12, 2005 (2005), health issues began to gain greater visibility. Thus, there is a need to think about and problematize the forms of work organization and socio-professional relationships in public service (Ramminger & Nardi, 2007).\nThe case presented here reports an intervention in health promotion at work carried out in the accounting and finance sector of a federal university. Therefore, this is an advisory report provided to this sector, which was responsible for coordinating and overseeing the institution’s budget, as well as managing contracts and agreements. Among other duties, the workers in this sector checked all payments made by the institution daily to avoid improper or incorrect entries; issued commitment notes, which guaranteed the reservation of resources for payment to companies or individuals who had contracts with the University; and dealt with the payment of scholarships and allowances.\nThe initial demand for the intervention came from the collective of workers referred to the University’s Pro-Rectory of Personnel Management, after seven servants requested removal from the sector due to conflicts with managers. The complaint concerned the difficult relationship with the leadership and the imposition of new rules. The servants also highlighted the lack of autonomy, as decisions were made unilaterally by the leadership, authoritatively, without dialogue with the group. There were also changes in work processes without prior communication with the team. These issues reflected in low motivation for work and the interest of several servants in changing sectors. However, the removal of all servants from one sector to another, even within the same public administration body, was not a plausible solution.\nIn light of this, what would justify a health promotion intervention based on the problems presented, as they were not directly related to physical or mental illnesses? This is due to an understanding that health is not the opposite of illness: it is possible to lose health even before falling ill. Having health, in this way, is being able to act and, especially, being able to reinvent oneself in the face of difficulties encountered in the activity carried out at work. Therefore, health is impaired when the worker’s power to act is limited (Clot, 2010).\nIt is thus seen that the ability of the servants in the accounting and finance sector to reorganize their activities in the face of imposed limits was curtailed to the point that they assessed that the only possible path was to leave the sector. In this sense, a health promotion intervention was necessary to allow these workers to regain their power to act. In light of this, a work psychologist and a group of psychology student interns linked to the institution’s Pro-Rectory of Personnel Management took on the demand and promoted an intervention that, as will be seen below, repositioned the workers in the face of their own activity and the demands presented, as well as opened a communication channel with the managers.\nThe intervention carried out was based on the Activity Clinic, which proposes to be a theory of action and transformation in work contexts. This perspective emphasizes the importance of strengthening and developing the work collective. To understand the Activity Clinic, it is important to elucidate the concept of craft, defined as the structure resulting from the conflict between four dimensions, which are: impersonal, transpersonal, personal, and interpersonal (Clot, 2010).\nThe impersonal dimension comprises the rules and conditions to which workers are subject, such as arrival and departure times, materials and work tools, safety standards, and procedure manuals. The transpersonal dimension (or professional genre) also concerns norms. In this case, however, they are those formulated by the work collective itself, constitutive of an implicit professional culture that, even if not formally recorded, guides workers’ actions in moments of difficulty. Each professional, in turn, imprints their history on the activity they perform and also develops new rules based on their experiences. That is why the craft is also personal. Finally, work is done in interaction with other people (colleagues, managers, consumers, among others), which characterizes the interpersonal level (Clot, 2010).\nIt is also pertinent to understand the distinction between performed activity and real activity (Clot, 2006). The first consists of the actions that the worker effectively performs at their workstation and that, in many cases, are visible to an external observer. The real activity, in turn, is the set of possibilities that, at some point, were on the worker’s horizon of action but were not realized. It is from the real activity that it becomes possible to renew the possibilities of acting in work contexts.\nUnderstanding these definitions, the work psychologist who works from the Activity Clinic can help workers revitalize professional cultures and also seek new forms of action from the real activity. In this way, it is possible to develop the power to act on the work environment, the organization, and oneself, which therefore implies promoting health.\nFrom this perspective, it is not up to the psychologist to make a diagnosis and inventory the psychosocial risks to which workers are exposed. It will be up to her to mediate reflections on the activity so that professionals can find psychosocial and personal resources to perform quality work. It is, thus, her role to assist in the search for unpredictable action capacities in the midst of activity and help rediscover the pleasures of well-done work, considered the driving force of health (Clot, 2017). To this end, the Activity Clinic mobilizes and promotes dialogue, aiming to resume collective creation and, thus, take care of work. Debates are promoted between workers, who hold the knowledge about their own activity, and later, between them and their managers (Clot, 2017).",

    "section": "Method",
    "text": "Method\n\nParticipants\nThe intervention involved four accountants, one female accountant, one male accounting technician, and one female accounting technician, as well as the immediate and superior managers, both accountants, totaling nine participants. All the servants held the position of Technical-Administrative in Education (TAE) at the Higher Education Institution (IES) and, as mentioned earlier, worked in the accounting and finance sector.\n\n\nProcedures, Instruments, and Course of the Intervention\nBefore starting the presentation about the instruments and procedures used in the intervention, it is important to recall the idea that in the Activity Clinic, no preliminary diagnosis is made that would provide the psychologist with prescriptions that workers must follow to solve problems related to the activity or to gain more health and satisfaction. It is also not her goal to produce a list of risks, whether physical, ergonomic, or psychosocial, to produce an external evaluation of the work.\nThe aim is, from the workers’ protagonism, to put action in motion, to dialogue about it, and, with that, to break the barriers of crystallized activities, those that are already established and can no longer handle the challenges faced by workers. Thus, the goal is to rediscover new ways of acting in the activity and in the midst of discussions with the work collective (therefore in the interpersonal dimension of the craft), facilitating workers’ reflection to expand their power to act (Clot, 2006). That said, it is also worth clarifying that all the stages described below are part of the intervention and that the procedures and instruments presented are used as mediators to achieve the objective indicated above.\nInitially, two meetings were held with the managers of the accounting and finance sector to explain the work proposal. On these occasions, the objectives of the action and the methodology that would be employed were presented. A similar procedure was followed with the servants, and subsequently, a working group was created with those who agreed to participate. The intervention was divided into three stages:\n\nDocument analysis;\nObservation of activities and\nConducting instructions to the double (ID).\n\nIn the first stage, documents that characterized, regulated, and standardized the workers’ activities were sought. The duties of the sector, its objectives, and its organizational structure were also analyzed. Additionally, the technical processes developed and the tasks explicitly assigned to the servants, as well as positions and functions of the sector, were examined. The aim was to understand the prescriptions of activities, norms, and procedures, as well as the general characteristics of work organization, that is, the impersonal dimension of the craft. The intention was thus to build the basis for dialogue between the working group and the intervention team, as well as among the workers themselves, through which the conflict over the quality of work could be thought about and debated (Clot, 2013). However, as will be seen later, some of these norms were not clearly defined for either managers or workers.\nIn the second phase, observations were made to access the performed activities. This procedure yields a double result. The first is linked to producing knowledge about the observed object, the activity, following a tradition well developed by ergonomics and other approaches that value the study of situated work. The second, in turn, is related to the fact that the observation already generates an intervention in the field by producing an internal dialogue in the worker (Clot, 2010). From this perspective, it was possible to understand and analyze work processes and identify problems and potentialities related to professionals’ engagement with the changes to be made in procedures.\nThe days and times of observations were previously agreed upon with the servants, and at the end of each visit, the team produced a report based on what was seen and what was said by the sector employees. Seven observation moments, each lasting an average of 3 hours, were conducted. Once this process was completed, a meeting was held with all the servants to discuss the systematizations produced. It was then possible to discuss suggestions and improvements proposed by the workers, which were negotiated and debated with the sector management. Thus, a partnership was established between managers and servants to implement the necessary measures.\nUpon completion of this stage, the third phase began, in which two meetings were held to conduct the ID, which consists of a technique where the activity clinician gives the following directive to the worker: “suppose I am your double and that tomorrow I will replace you in your workplace. What instructions should you give me so that no one notices the substitution?” (Clot, 2006, p. 144). For this stage, the group was divided into two according to the nature of the activities performed.\nIn each subgroup, one servant was asked to volunteer to be the double’s instructor, who was a member of the intervention team. After the instruction was completed, a space was opened for the other group members, who were in the observer position, to participate. They could then explain disagreements, questions, and additions regarding the worker’s speech in the instructor position. Once the instructions to the double were completed, the recorded speeches were transcribed and returned to the servants so they could read and extract points for discussion.\nNext, meetings were held with each subgroup to discuss the points highlighted by them from reading the transcribed material. Among the themes addressed by the servants in these meetings, discussions included the nature of activities; rework and overload; the need for training; meeting goals; relationships with management; control of the information registration system, among others. Finally, meetings were held to discuss these issues with all the working group members.\nThe intervention concluded with a general meeting where workers and managers discussed the demands raised at each stage and the changes made that were favorable to the group in the development of their activities. There was also a debate on suggested improvements that were not achieved for various reasons, including legal limits imposed on the public sector.",

The development of the power to act and the strengthening of workers around issues related to the impersonal dimension, specifically regarding work conditions and organization, and interpersonal relationships, were observed.\nRegarding working conditions, the servants stated that there was little space for circulation in the room where they worked, as it was small for the amount of furniture it had. Concerning the available tools for performing activities, they pointed out that most did not have a mousepad with arm support, which is important when spending long periods using computers and performing continuous movements. It was also suggested that this could lead them to develop repetitive strain injuries.\nAdditionally, there was a lack of essential materials for performing activities, such as highlighters, to mark important values in notes to be entered into the system, and rulers and pens in good condition, as those provided by the university were of inferior quality and soon became unusable. Given this, workers ended up buying these and other materials themselves. In light of these issues and the impediments they posed to their activities, the collective could debate proposals discussed with the managers during the intervention, such as reorganizing the desks and chairs to improve circulation in the room and requesting consumable materials directly from the pro-rector to the warehouse sector, so that requests were met in a timely manner, as the response time to individual requests was very long.\nRegarding aspects related to work organization, the lack of clear and defined prescription was one of the main complaints raised by the servants, as the sector did not have an established workflow chart guiding how activities should be performed. The prescription consists of the task, norms, values, obligations, and procedures previously anticipated by the organization. Thus, it is understood that the lack of clarity on this generates doubts and uncertainties for performing activities. In this sense, while excessive prescription prevents creations and stylizations, its absence leaves the worker without a guide by which they can orient their actions, which can paralyze them (Pinheiro et al., 2016).\nGiven this lack, the intervention facilitators tried to refer the group to the informal prescriptions established by the work collective, the transpersonal dimension of the craft. They tried to make explicit, therefore, tacit guidelines that guided actions so that mutual support was provided for doubts and unforeseen events arising from what the formal prescription showed insufficient. Thus, it was possible to strengthen the work group by making explicit a professional genre (Clot, 2010) that guided them, allowing the establishment of some guidelines, especially regarding each one’s duties, sector process flows, and procedures to be followed when problems were identified. It is thus perceived that “the power of (re)creation in the work environment develops from the appropriation of resources for action elaborated in the collective” (Souto et al., 2015, p. 13), that is, in the professional genre, resources for performing activities can be mobilized.\nStill regarding work organization, the collective debated the goals set for the sector. It was noticed that these were inappropriately constructed, as they did not consider the activity flow. It was complained that the unachievable goals were defined without group participation and imposed hierarchically. The way results were measured did not match reality. The servants then created an activity monitoring spreadsheet to establish future goals with the management, considering the sector’s reality and needs.\nAnother demand brought by the workers concerned the lack of dialogue between them and their managers. In many cases, the servants’ autonomy was constantly curtailed by decisions from superiors. Thus, feeling alienated from their activity, the servants were unmotivated to carry out tasks and performed them dispassionately, fearing that, at any moment, other changes could be imposed without the collective’s consent. Additionally, the managers’ inability to dialogue also led to the workers having only necessary, unfriendly, or even hostile communication among themselves.\nThis generated a stiffening of relationships and an exacerbation of individualities, resulting in frequent removal requests, which caused high turnover in the sector, aggravated by the management’s practice of constantly changing servants’ functions. It was observed that these changes were imposed hierarchically without the participation of those who would stop performing their previous function and start performing a new one, without any prior debate or consultation about their interest in performing this new task. When they felt capable of performing a function, for example, by reading specific legislation, and were trained and accustomed to their activity, they were relocated to a new function without any justification.\nAll this resulted in difficulties for the group to recognize itself as a work collective, as the servants did not see in each other a peer to refer to or turn to in difficult situations. This brings to light the mention that the sense of belonging to a collective allows the preservation of the craft. The set of possible and impossible actions, the tacit agreements made between the group, constitute a generic resource that acts as a guide for individual activity. When the renewal of the genre is hindered, the collective is exposed to the unforeseen realities, and the subjects can no longer recognize themselves in what they do (Clot, 2010).\nDuring the intervention, there was a change in one of the managers. Throughout the discussions in the instruction to the double, the workers stated that the new manager had training in the area of expertise and was always available, sensitive to the group’s demands, which positively impacted this relationship. The new management accepted, for example, the proposal for annual rotation with servants who performed mechanical and repetitive activities, using the same keyboard commands and computer screen to analyze various processes daily. Some processed up to 50 cases daily, which made it “tedious, repetitive, and tiring,” in the words of one of the accounting technicians.\nAnother change implemented by the new management, at the collective’s request, was decentralizing some activities to other sectors, reducing the workload. The practice of assigning accounting workers to functions of other sectors’ servants on vacation was also suspended, as it caused workload and dissatisfaction among the group, as the new function was not within their duties and should be performed by someone from the original sector.",

    "text": "Conclusions and Limitations of the Intervention\nThe intervention was carried out in a context marked by servants’ demotivation and various problems related to work organization and conditions, as well as the relationship between servants and their managers. Numerous debates on the activity and craft were promoted, allowing workers to find new ways of proceeding and to dialogue with managers about the difficulties encountered, positively contributing to the group’s interpersonal relationships. Thus, there was an expansion of the power to act, which, from the Activity Clinic perspective, means promoting health. As a limitation, the initial difficulty of sensitizing the managers about the importance of considering the proposals brought by the workers as necessary for the proper development of activities was observed.\nAnother limitation concerned some old and therefore outdated federal legislation that did not keep up with the institution’s changes and modernization processes, generating a contradiction between the innovations imposed by management and the rigidity of the regulations, making some processes more cumbersome due to bureaucracy, whereas they could be more agile. However, modifying or updating the legislation is carried out by higher, external instances to the university itself, as it is linked to the mobilization of federal ministerial bodies.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis chapter describes and analyzes psychosocial interventions with children and adolescents in an urban periphery of Fortaleza, Ceará. It is written by many hands - students, professors, and social articulators - aligning with the commitment to listen to a plurality of voices that ethically bring us closer to the social complexity of ways of existence in various territories. The practices in focus were carried out between 2019 and 2020 and are related to the project Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção, part of university extension in Social Psychology, linked to the research and study group on Violence, Social Exclusion, and Subjectivation (VIESES) and the Department of Psychology of the Federal University of Ceará (UFC).\nSince 2019, through the articulation with the NGO Centro de Defesa da Vida Herbert de Souza (CDVHS), the Extension Project Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção has been hosted by the Centro de Cidadania e Valorização Humana (CCVH) in the Nova Canudos occupation, in the Canindezinho neighborhood. Given the demand for actions, projects, and activities with children in this area, we built participatory methodologies as experiences that strengthen them as political subjects in the community. Additionally, the actions also emerge from the possibility of conducting training and research activities with children in a peripheral context. During the first year, a group entitled “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos” was consolidated, composed on average of twenty-two (22) children, mostly black, poor, and public school students aged between 6 and 12 years, as well as researchers, students, articulators, and social movement activists, residents of the occupation.\nIn 2020, the demand, made explicit at the beginning of the partnership, persisted and expanded due to the children’s need to:\nAll these demands were crossed by the collective analysis of what was possible to do virtually, given the worsening social inequalities, directly related to the children’s access to social networks. At the same time, other desires were being mobilized and resisted the erasure generated by the naturalization of the precariousness of life in a peripheral context. This created flows for experiments in the audiovisual production scope of children on YouTube, TikTok, and WhatsApp.\nWe start the text by relating peripheral territorialities and modes of subjectivation, as well as repositioning problems and ways of doing. Next, we address the conditions of insertion in the field from a cartographic and procedural perspective, as well as the joint creation of the existential territory in which inter(in)ventive and participatory actions with children and adolescents from the Nova Canudos occupation are forged. These actions are articulated with the CCVH, which not only hosts but is also invented in the political agency of children and adolescents. Finally, we highlight ways of doing (group device) that draw the field of forces of this existential territory, emphasizing the challenges of conducting demands collectively.",

    "text": "Peripheral territorialities and modes of subjectivation: acting starts by knowing how to invent other problems\nFrom what place do we speak? With whom do we articulate these interventions highlighted here? What knowledge is constructed with Nova Canudos? These questions guide us in writing this topic, beginning by highlighting the narratives of residents and social articulators about this community, as well as socioeconomic indicators present in documents about the neighborhood that come to life in exchanges with children and adolescents.\nNova Canudos was born in 1993 as a popular occupation influenced by the Base Ecclesial Communities (CEBs), a movement of the Catholic church oriented by Liberation Theology that tried to link faith and life in pastoral actions. This is because one of the strong issues in the lives of many families in the 1990s in Fortaleza was precisely access to land in the city to guarantee the right to housing. Thus, with the support of the local church, the land was occupied, and the land plots were informally organized. In these, an area was reserved to build a local facility for religious celebrations and community problem discussions. This area gave rise to the Centro de Cidadania e Valorização Humana (CCVH), which is still maintained today as a reference for collective activities carried out in Nova Canudos. In another area, another community center was built with the support of a project called Mãos Unidas, in which volunteer doctors provided care for the population. This facility was incorporated into the basic health care network and is now home to the Abner Cavalcante Brasil Basic Health Unit, the only public health post in the Special Zone of Social Interest (ZEIS) of Bom Jardim, which serves Nova Canudos and other residents of neighboring communities.\nNova Canudos is located in the Canindezinho neighborhood, which, until 2020, was one of the neighborhoods in the Greater Bom Jardim (GBJ) region. As of municipal law no. 278 of 2019, which establishes a new regionalization in the city of Fortaleza, and decree no. 14.590 of 2020, the Canindezinho neighborhood became part of the Regional Executive Secretariat - SER X, being separated from what officially became considered GBJ - SER V (Fortaleza, 2021). The area has high indicators of urban violence and concentrations of poverty and extreme poverty, with a population of 211 thousand inhabitants, according to the Census - IBGE (2010). Given the state’s neglect, popular political articulation became strong, which explains the engagement of residents, from children to - especially - young people and adults, in resident associations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), collectives, and other instruments that allow their participation in the process of organizing, mobilizing, and overseeing public policies aimed at the periphery. Among these articulations present in GBJ, we highlight the action of the Centro de Defesa da Vida Herbert Souza (CDVHS).\nGiven the ethical-political commitment to confronting the processes of vulnerabilization of children’s lives, combined with the recognition of participation practices and community organization historically carried out in GBJ, Nova Canudos became an empowered peripheral territory, open to jointly problematizing the relationships between children and modes of participation, in a contextualized perspective integrated with the children’s movements in the community, highlighting the fact that they are the target audience of the activities carried out and hosted by the CCVH.\nIn this context, a Decolonial Social Psychology (J. P. P. Barros et al., 2017, 2019; Mayorga, 2014), as a network of knowledge, supports the actions of Maquinarias: Infâncias em Invenção and is eventful between the university and peripheries. Events hold the potency of institutions that can denaturalize and produce breaches in the rigid perceptions of the social fabric and materialize in a racist, sexist, classist, heteronormative, and adult-centric web. Therefore, in this work, peripheries and universities are not given, ready, and finished places, but mutually constitute themselves through combined strategies and strive to denaturalize historical relations of distance and colonization.\nThis partnership, on which we now focus, can reposition social stigmas around the urban peripheries of Fortaleza, in line with the notion that these territories are plural and centers of life production, constantly disputing with hegemonic narratives of disqualification and criminalization. From this perspective, it has been possible to articulate children from different peripheral realities by integrating them into activities of other partner projects, creating records (photographs and videos) of children’s collective action, and participating in public calls to maintain activities, with greater visibility of their ways of life, outside of stereotyped views that minimize their participation in the city. Thus, clues are produced that help denaturalize conceptions of childhood historically constituted in a colonial past, establishing them as a developmental condition that must go through schooling processes and family protection for the full exercise of citizenship (Castro, 2013; Kuhn Junior & De Mello, 2020; Sarmento, 2013).\nRepositioning oneself ethically, aesthetically, and politically operates the invention of other problems with which to move thought. Being WITH complicates ways of acting, requiring negotiations, dialogues, and exchanges in which power-knowledge relations can have their effects analyzed, in order not to corroborate the historical silencing of subalternized classes, which, intersectionally, produce gender, generation, class, and ethnicity/race oppressions. In these two years of action, we have composed some clues for producing situated and implicated problems with which we have (un)learned: a) the need for articulation with territory agents, strengthening struggles and paths built collectively; b) the need for network monitoring of children and adolescents, paying attention to the constantly renewed trust bonds with them and their guardians; c) openness to experience and methodological creativity to carry out non-directed activities that respond to the collective agency of children and the singularization of their processes and demands.",

    "text": "Conditions of field insertion from a cartographic perspective\nMaquinarias arrived in 2019 in the territory of Greater Bom Jardim (GBJ) through partnership bonds between social actors and VIESES. These actors, members of the CDVHS, were responsible for building and partially maintaining the bridge that has extended between Maquinarias and CCVH for 2 years. In this community space in Nova Canudos, there were already occasional activities promoted by and for residents, such as capoeira and theater classes, craft workshops for making bracelets, and, not rarely, religious celebrations that mobilized different generational groups. Despite the lack of state assistance, the space remained active and reverberated the effects of collective actions by residents, integrating into the community network in Nova Canudos as a support point for cultural, training, and assistance activities for the population.\nThis organization signaled the CCVH’s openness to the proposition and collective construction of activities with children and adolescents, making it possible for expectations, methodology, and objectives to emerge as an effect of the meetings. This perspective materialized and resonated with the inter(in)ventive and participatory action proposal that the extension project aspired to outline and put into practice (Costa et al., 2020).\nOn the first visit to the CCVH, with the mediation of CDVHS articulators, Maquinarias found, in addition to a resident and member of the association’s board of directors, ten children who, curious about the movement, approached and opened the way, without ceasing to “evaluate” the visitors. In this movement of getting to know and inventing each other, children, articulators, extensionists, and researchers set out to join, following an unforeseen flow, piece by piece, the gears of a new collective in the territory. The name forged for this group by the children themselves, still in the first meeting, “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos,” became quite indicative of how intervention, participation, and (micro)political agency intertwined to consolidate ways of creating, mapping, and processually accompanying an existential territory (L. P. Barros & Kastrup, 2009). In their propositions, the children tension adult-centric models of action, centered on the FOR, and shift them to a doing WITH, articulating and creating spaces to fulfill their demands, besides inhabiting the community center while (re)inventing it.\nThe very insertion of Maquinarias in this existential territory showed itself as a continuous movement, of renewed attempts and conquests of the group’s trust and acceptance, which did not remain static either due to the arrival of new children, their growth, or posture changes. Similarly, the extension project renewed itself through new cycles and commitments between fields of action and the university. These changes impacted the composition of forces and affective ties that mutually constitute Maquinarias and the Nova Canudos collective, understood as group, inter(in)ventive devices, and therefore effects of daily insurgencies, woven in encounters with children and adolescents. Thus, taking cartography as a research and intervention method, university extension activities are combined with the analytical process of a complex reality that occurs in the field, from the implication of extensionists and social articulators in collectively invented actions that produce problems, making the production of knowledge and practice inseparable (Costa et al., 2020; Passos & Barros, 2009).\nThe fact that we consider the processuality that accompanies these bonds - university and periphery, Invenções and Maquinarias, children and extensionists, and many others - brings visibility to important factors, such as:\n\nthe geographical distances that mainly adults traveled to reach the meetings and how these distances - the places to which each belongs - influence how each one connects, highlighting different conditions of vulnerabilities and social privileges;\nthe context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has persisted since the beginning of the second year of the collective’s existence, with all its obstacles, such as the impossibility of face-to-face meetings, unequal access to the internet, and the worsening social vulnerability conditions that permeate the group; and\nthe context of urban violence that surrounds the Nova Canudos occupation. This moving map requires, therefore, the insertion in the field as an attitude and not just a fixed pact, with positions delimited and defined prior to the very process of linking.\n\nThe inhabited territory, therefore, was never given, nor was a flag planted in the corner of the CCVH yard, or any other place that Invenções occupied, claiming Maquinarias’ permanence in that location. It is, however, the confluence of desires and demands that circulate the collective that ties its members and establishes a continuous flow of activities, whether virtual or face-to-face.",

    "text": "“Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos”: actions of an intergenerational collective\nA fundamental question seems to us to resume at this point in the text: the fact that the psychosocial interventions in focus here were carried out in the alternation between different creative processes, being the result of collective agencies, which we mapped in their subjectivation effects, without neutralities and/or hierarchical relations. They have marks that we consider potent for actions that place themselves micropolitically in the face of collective and community processes, which directly touch the challenges of political participation in intergenerational groups. Let’s see:\n\nOpenness to improvisation;\nAvailability for creation and experimentation without closed scripts;\nInterest in using and researching materials that favor diverse ways of participation, not necessarily linked to oral discourse;\nInterest in working with groups and willingness to do things together, in order to distance oneself from a specialist (expert) posture.\n\nThus, the “WITH children and adolescents” becomes a trigger for the joint planning of content, materials, places, process records, forms of dissemination, and effects for the group and the community.\nWe understand openness not only to differentiation but also to the group’s becomings and, consequently, to the processuality and heterogeneity of field actions as a way of intervening in the complexity of group agencies (R. B. Barros, 2007). Extensionists and researchers move themselves and the field, faced with the proposal to produce WITH the children and learn from the encounters, also facing the challenge of conducting demands collectively. We bet that this (ethical) posture is close to that defined by the cartography of subjectivation processes, that is: an existential territory is produced by engaging in daily and collectively invented experiences (Alvarez & Passos, 2009).\nThe group’s composition is diverse in terms of age, class, race, and gender markers, with children being able to move between meetings, with the number of participants varying from 15 to 20. This way of being together tensions conceptions of collectives and subjects that are homogeneous and fixed by an identity ideal, understanding a multiplicity of ways of collectively composing that can happen in each field of forces (R. B. Barros, 2007).\n\nActions in 2019: invention of a group device\nThe actions in the first year, totaling 16 meetings, established being and doing together as a device, with Invenções being a strategy to be seen not only in the community by other generational groups (family members, church group members, and social movement articulators) and by their peers but also in other territories. Additionally, acting collectively and being heard mobilized the children’s desire for two types, both playful and free, of activity: situated, carried out biweekly at the CCVH headquarters, and displaced, carried out in city tours. We will see that in 2020, due to other space-time relations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions were described in a way that these conditions were made visible.\nThe meetings held at the CCVH included drawing workshops; making toys from recyclable materials; movie screenings; collective mapping of places where children circulate in the city; and semester start and end celebrations.\nThe children’s periodic presence at the CCVH mobilized the association’s board to ensure a space for the Invenções group to store productions, materials used, toys, among other needs. This achievement resulted from negotiating the common use of the space with other groups, fostering the participation and visibility of children in the community. Moreover, actions WITH the children became continuous in the territory, not just occasional.\nCity tours and visits to other places in Fortaleza allowed the children to encounter the public dimension of the city that is often denied to them by the walls of social exclusion and urban socio-spatial inequalities. Moving through Fortaleza, beyond Nova Canudos, aligned with the children’s desire and happened through the invitation that Invenções received to participate in two events: the “II Colorindo O Gênero,” a program that is part of the “Curta o Gênero,” annually promoted by the NGO Fábrica de Imagens: ações educativas em cidadania e gênero, and the 2019 edition held at the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura; and the “International Children’s Theater Festival of Ceará” (TIC), with theatrical performances at the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ), both facilities of the Ceará State Culture Secretariat (SECULT-CE). The lack of information on how to access public facilities (theater, cinema, parks, museums), in addition to the personal circumstances that hinder each one, often distances them from the possibility of using them. Thus, the movements experienced by the children problematize feelings of belonging to the city and the possibilities it offers.\nBeing able to move around the city with the children, besides being their desire, proved to be an activity of enormous impact and an important analyzer of the existing boundaries in the city, which invisibilize people living in peripheral territories. These are daily naturalized boundaries that need to be transformed. In this sense, the described tours were powerful opportunities to symbolically and concretely move our way of being in the territories, understood as a vector producing subjectivities.\n\n\nActions in 2020: recomposition of movements amid the pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic crossed the compositions of university extension and the Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos group, impacting temporalities and ways of accompanying and narrating collective actions. In this context, participation in the public call launched by the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ) with resources from the Poverty Combating Fund (FECOP) enabled the group to remain active and resistant in its collective actions during 2020.\nInvenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos took on the dimension of a project and was awarded in the said Edital, in which children, social articulators, and Maquinarias members were proponents, resulting in cost support for maintaining the activities carried out and strengthening our ties with other neighborhood facilities. The proposition of activities occurred in line with collective demands, implying interventions at the CCVH headquarters, such as purchasing equipment, painting, repairs, and mobilization for cleaning and maintaining the headquarters.\nDuring this period, due to the impossibility of holding face-to-face meetings, movements in social networks were fertilized, interconnecting everyday experiences through exchanges and shares. Despite the pandemic, strengthening bonds, making, and inventing WITH the children continued as our ethical horizon. Therefore, the meetings began to take place through the Google Meet platform, with the WhatsApp group being the space for daily conversations, action agreements, emergence, and sharing of ideas, listening to demands and interests, becoming, thus, a new territory to explore and build. Considering the undemocratic access to the internet and specific demands, we managed to hold some face-to-face meetings, respecting care protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The monitoring of these activities and the mobilization for them to occur took place continuously, almost daily.\nWe call virtual actions those that focused on themes of interest to children and adolescents, as well as those related to the capillarization of their participation in virtual events:\n\n“I Virtual Drawing Exhibition of Maquinarias”;\n“Meeting to talk about YouTube usage”;\n“Collective book readings”;\n“Participation in III Colorindo O Gênero”; and\n“Participation in the 30th Anniversary Live of the Child and Adolescent Statute”.\n\nThe virtual drawing exhibition mobilized us amid the daily life of social isolation, keeping us connected through free expression and each one’s situation at the moment. The drawings were exhibited on the projects’ and CCVH’s social networks. The workshop on the relationships between children and YouTube usage, held in partnership with the Laboratory for Research on Relations Between Childhood, Youth, and Media (LABGRIM), linked to the Institute of Culture and Art/ICA of UFC, emerged from the children’s experiments to create YouTube channels and the desire to talk about their inspirations and goals. From this, it was possible to create a moment to reflect on content production for/on the platform, image exposure, inspirations, and most accessed channels, self-care, and safety.\nMoments to experience reading collectively proved to be powerful, from the expectation of the meeting, through the playful and participatory dimension assumed by the group members. Exchanging perceptions and meanings about the work was a reason for joy, despite the difficulties imposed by low-quality connections and access modes, usually made via cell phones. During mobilizations around the 30th anniversary of the Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA), one of the Invenções girls participated in a live event promoted by the Ceará Children’s Rights Defense Forum (Fórum DCA Ceará), expressing her views on racism and the challenges of the pandemic, as well as reciting two self-authored poems.\nA second set of activities resulted from articulations in the territory, with members of the extension and research team, CDVHS articulators, and the Local, Integrated, and Sustainable Development Network (Rede Dlis), and with the children themselves, namely:\n\n“Distribution of masks and WHO guideline booklet”;\n“Distribution of ‘Invenções e Distração’ kits”;\n“Two cinema sessions at CCVH”;\n“Mutirão de limpeza no CCVH”; and\n“Audiovisual course”.\n\nAll activities required face-to-face meetings, possible at specific times during the COVID-19 pandemic - the presence of these moments was also due to the need to listen to the children’s coping modes and their mental health. The theme of self-care and care for others, as a collective issue, permeated the activities of sharing information about the new coronavirus’s spread and the territory and country’s situation. Thus, the group established itself as a health promotion device, directly related to the children’s experiences, doubts, difficulties, and ideas raised as a collective.",

The work requires mediation, implication, and continuous active listening to the children, demanding flexibility and methodological creativity.\nIts elaboration characterizes a sensitive, ethical, and contextualized work, through the construction and maintenance of spaces where the exercise of the right to participation by children is real. The collective production of knowledge repositions the university, leaving the imposing place of the center to occupy the place of sharing, of implicated thinking, as one of the forces that produce a common space. From this perspective, learning with the “Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos” decolonizes the research field on children’s social participation and strengthens the effects of their actions on community life and public policies impacting peripheral contexts in Fortaleza.\nWe hope that the shared tracks and trails can inspire other actors and territories, once ethically oriented by the interest in creating conditions for children’s participation from their life contexts and daily lives, as well as an invitation to experience creativity and methodological diversity linked to listening to children and adolescents and the desires they mobilize for changes in the social body.",

    "text": "“Inventions of the Children of Nova Canudos”: actions of an intergenerational collective\nA fundamental question seems to us to resume at this point in the text: the fact that the psychosocial interventions in focus here were carried out in the alternation between different creative processes, being the result of collective agencies, which we mapped in their subjectivation effects, without neutralities and/or hierarchical relations. They have marks that we consider potent for actions that place themselves micropolitically in the face of collective and community processes, which directly touch the challenges of political participation in intergenerational groups. Let’s see:\n\nOpenness to improvisation;\nAvailability for creation and experimentation without closed scripts;\nInterest in using and researching materials that favor diverse ways of participation, not necessarily linked to oral discourse;\nInterest in working with groups and willingness to do things together, in order to distance oneself from a specialist (expert) posture.\n\nThus, the “WITH children and adolescents” becomes a trigger for the joint planning of content, materials, places, process records, forms of dissemination, and effects for the group and the community.\nWe understand openness not only to differentiation but also to the group’s becomings and, consequently, to the processuality and heterogeneity of field actions as a way of intervening in the complexity of group agencies (R. B. Barros, 2007). Extensionists and researchers move themselves and the field, faced with the proposal to produce WITH the children and learn from the encounters, also facing the challenge of conducting demands collectively. We bet that this (ethical) posture is close to that defined by the cartography of subjectivation processes, that is: an existential territory is produced by engaging in daily and collectively invented experiences (Alvarez & Passos, 2009).\nThe group’s composition is diverse in terms of age, class, race, and gender markers, with children being able to move between meetings, with the number of participants varying from 15 to 20. This way of being together tensions conceptions of collectives and subjects that are homogeneous and fixed by an identity ideal, understanding a multiplicity of ways of collectively composing that can happen in each field of forces (R. B. Barros, 2007).\n\nActions in 2019: invention of a group device\nThe actions in the first year, totaling 16 meetings, established being and doing together as a device, with Invenções being a strategy to be seen not only in the community by other generational groups (family members, church group members, and social movement articulators) and by their peers but also in other territories. Additionally, acting collectively and being heard mobilized the children’s desire for two types, both playful and free, of activity: situated, carried out biweekly at the CCVH headquarters, and displaced, carried out in city tours. We will see that in 2020, due to other space-time relations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions were described in a way that these conditions were made visible.\nThe meetings held at the CCVH included drawing workshops; making toys from recyclable materials; movie screenings; collective mapping of places where children circulate in the city; and semester start and end celebrations.\nThe children’s periodic presence at the CCVH mobilized the association’s board to ensure a space for the Invenções group to store productions, materials used, toys, among other needs. This achievement resulted from negotiating the common use of the space with other groups, fostering the participation and visibility of children in the community. Moreover, actions WITH the children became continuous in the territory, not just occasional.\nCity tours and visits to other places in Fortaleza allowed the children to encounter the public dimension of the city that is often denied to them by the walls of social exclusion and urban socio-spatial inequalities. Moving through Fortaleza, beyond Nova Canudos, aligned with the children’s desire and happened through the invitation that Invenções received to participate in two events: the “II Colorindo O Gênero,” a program that is part of the “Curta o Gênero,” annually promoted by the NGO Fábrica de Imagens: ações educativas em cidadania e gênero, and the 2019 edition held at the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura; and the “International Children’s Theater Festival of Ceará” (TIC), with theatrical performances at the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ), both facilities of the Ceará State Culture Secretariat (SECULT-CE). The lack of information on how to access public facilities (theater, cinema, parks, museums), in addition to the personal circumstances that hinder each one, often distances them from the possibility of using them. Thus, the movements experienced by the children problematize feelings of belonging to the city and the possibilities it offers.\nBeing able to move around the city with the children, besides being their desire, proved to be an activity of enormous impact and an important analyzer of the existing boundaries in the city, which invisibilize people living in peripheral territories. These are daily naturalized boundaries that need to be transformed. In this sense, the described tours were powerful opportunities to symbolically and concretely move our way of being in the territories, understood as a vector producing subjectivities.\n\n\nActions in 2020: recomposition of movements amid the pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic crossed the compositions of university extension and the Invenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos group, impacting temporalities and ways of accompanying and narrating collective actions. In this context, participation in the public call launched by the Centro Cultural do Grande Bom Jardim (CCBJ) with resources from the Poverty Combating Fund (FECOP) enabled the group to remain active and resistant in its collective actions during 2020.\nInvenções das Crianças de Nova Canudos took on the dimension of a project and was awarded in the said Edital, in which children, social articulators, and Maquinarias members were proponents, resulting in cost support for maintaining the activities carried out and strengthening our ties with other neighborhood facilities. The proposition of activities occurred in line with collective demands, implying interventions at the CCVH headquarters, such as purchasing equipment, painting, repairs, and mobilization for cleaning and maintaining the headquarters.\nDuring this period, due to the impossibility of holding face-to-face meetings, movements in social networks were fertilized, interconnecting everyday experiences through exchanges and shares. Despite the pandemic, strengthening bonds, making, and inventing WITH the children continued as our ethical horizon. Therefore, the meetings began to take place through the Google Meet platform, with the WhatsApp group being the space for daily conversations, action agreements, emergence, and sharing of ideas, listening to demands and interests, becoming, thus, a new territory to explore and build. Considering the undemocratic access to the internet and specific demands, we managed to hold some face-to-face meetings, respecting care protocols to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The monitoring of these activities and the mobilization for them to occur took place continuously, almost daily.\nWe call virtual actions those that focused on themes of interest to children and adolescents, as well as those related to the capillarization of their participation in virtual events:\n\n“I Virtual Drawing Exhibition of Maquinarias”;\n“Meeting to talk about YouTube usage”;\n“Collective book readings”;\n“Participation in III Colorindo O Gênero”; and\n“Participation in the 30th Anniversary Live of the Child and Adolescent Statute”.\n\nThe virtual drawing exhibition mobilized us amid the daily life of social isolation, keeping us connected through free expression and each one’s situation at the moment. The drawings were exhibited on the projects’ and CCVH’s social networks. The workshop on the relationships between children and YouTube usage, held in partnership with the Laboratory for Research on Relations Between Childhood, Youth, and Media (LABGRIM), linked to the Institute of Culture and Art/ICA of UFC, emerged from the children’s experiments to create YouTube channels and the desire to talk about their inspirations and goals. From this, it was possible to create a moment to reflect on content production for/on the platform, image exposure, inspirations, and most accessed channels, self-care, and safety.\nMoments to experience reading collectively proved to be powerful, from the expectation of the meeting, through the playful and participatory dimension assumed by the group members. Exchanging perceptions and meanings about the work was a reason for joy, despite the difficulties imposed by low-quality connections and access modes, usually made via cell phones. During mobilizations around the 30th anniversary of the Child and Adolescent Statute (ECA), one of the Invenções girls participated in a live event promoted by the Ceará Children’s Rights Defense Forum (Fórum DCA Ceará), expressing her views on racism and the challenges of the pandemic, as well as reciting two self-authored poems.\nA second set of activities resulted from articulations in the territory, with members of the extension and research team, CDVHS articulators, and the Local, Integrated, and Sustainable Development Network (Rede Dlis), and with the children themselves, namely:\n\n“Distribution of masks and WHO guideline booklet”;\n“Distribution of ‘Invenções e Distração’ kits”;\n“Two cinema sessions at CCVH”;\n“Mutirão de limpeza no CCVH”; and\n“Audiovisual course”.\n\nAll activities required face-to-face meetings, possible at specific times during the COVID-19 pandemic - the presence of these moments was also due to the need to listen to the children’s coping modes and their mental health. The theme of self-care and care for others, as a collective issue, permeated the activities of sharing information about the new coronavirus’s spread and the territory and country’s situation. Thus, the group established itself as a health promotion device, directly related to the children’s experiences, doubts, difficulties, and ideas raised as a collective.",
